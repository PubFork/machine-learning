1
00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:12,570
what I want is set maybe<font color="#CCCCCC"> high-level</font>

2
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:14,100
vision<font color="#E5E5E5"> sheriff</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> view some some of the</font>

3
00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:15,510
ideas<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think are the big ideas in</font>

4
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:17,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">future learning and deep learning I</font>

5
00:00:15,510 --> 00:00:20,040
think the agenda of deep learning as the

6
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:21,869
idea of using brain simulations to make

7
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:23,790
learning albums my<font color="#E5E5E5"> Brendan easy to use</font>

8
00:00:21,869 --> 00:00:26,190
and also<font color="#E5E5E5"> make revolution advances in</font>

9
00:00:23,790 --> 00:00:28,380
machine learning nai so come back<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

10
00:00:26,190 --> 00:00:29,789
this later<font color="#E5E5E5"> but you know once</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> upon a time</font>

11
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:31,740
I guess when I was in high school I

12
00:00:29,789 --> 00:00:33,030
<font color="#CCCCCC">think I joined the field of machine</font>

13
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:35,489
learning because I want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> work on AI</font>

14
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:37,350
but somehow<font color="#E5E5E5"> that got lost and instead of</font>

15
00:00:35,489 --> 00:00:39,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually doing AI we wound up spending</font>

16
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:42,269
our lives doing curve fitting which is

17
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:44,070
not<font color="#CCCCCC"> what I signed up</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to do of and deep</font>

18
00:00:42,269 --> 00:00:45,330
learning was for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> first time in many</font>

19
00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:46,559
years made me think about the bigger

20
00:00:45,330 --> 00:00:48,600
dreams again I should come back<font color="#CCCCCC"> and say</font>

21
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:50,610
a bit<font color="#CCCCCC"> more about that and again I won't</font>

22
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:52,710
say you know the sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of vision and</font>

23
00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:54,510
ideas on a share is really not mine but

24
00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:57,030
as I think shared by large community

25
00:00:54,510 --> 00:00:59,129
including you know young Jeff<font color="#CCCCCC"> Fintan</font>

26
00:00:57,030 --> 00:01:01,559
yoshua bengio many others that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you hear</font>

27
00:00:59,129 --> 00:01:03,449
from in the next couple weeks what about

28
00:01:01,559 --> 00:01:05,640
computers do without data right we want

29
00:01:03,449 --> 00:01:07,470
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at images and label them look of</font>

30
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:10,350
audio listen to audio and do speech

31
00:01:07,470 --> 00:01:13,980
recognition have text and do stuff will

32
00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:16,260
text and it turns out that machine

33
00:01:13,980 --> 00:01:19,980
learning is our best shot<font color="#E5E5E5"> and most of</font>

34
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:21,660
these applications today but it is very

35
00:01:19,980 --> 00:01:24,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">difficult to get these applications work</font>

36
00:01:21,660 --> 00:01:26,460
right so while back I<font color="#E5E5E5"> all some of my</font>

37
00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:27,810
students at Stanford to use like a

38
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:29,640
state-of-the-art computer vision

39
00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:33,900
algorithms to to write the motorcycle

40
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:36,750
detector and this was the result be God

41
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:43,020
and this is typical in computer vision

42
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:45,450
right this is so um well even though

43
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:48,720
learning algorithms works each of those

44
00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:50,520
lines is like a you know six months<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

45
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:53,760
two years of work for a team of

46
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:55,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">engineers and and we light these</font>

47
00:01:53,760 --> 00:02:00,780
algorithms to be less work to build and

48
00:01:55,950 --> 00:02:02,070
also maybe perform better so let me

49
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:05,400
<font color="#CCCCCC">start to explain some of these ideas</font>

50
00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:07,229
using computer vision but and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

51
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:09,869
will talk a bit about audio and apply

52
00:02:07,229 --> 00:02:11,819
these albums other modalities as well so

53
00:02:09,869 --> 00:02:13,769
why<font color="#E5E5E5"> is this problem hard right so</font>

54
00:02:11,819 --> 00:02:15,569
obviously a motorcycle how on earth

55
00:02:13,769 --> 00:02:18,389
could the computer failed to recognize

56
00:02:15,569 --> 00:02:19,960
what this is zooming into small part of

57
00:02:18,389 --> 00:02:22,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">the image zooming into whether</font>

58
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:25,930
little red square is where you and I see

59
00:02:22,660 --> 00:02:29,380
a motorcycle the computer sees this so

60
00:02:25,930 --> 00:02:31,990
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> computer vision problem is to look</font>

61
00:02:29,380 --> 00:02:33,550
at all those pixel intensity<font color="#CCCCCC"> values and</font>

62
00:02:31,990 --> 00:02:35,260
tell you that all<font color="#CCCCCC"> those numbers</font>

63
00:02:33,550 --> 00:02:37,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">represent the exhaust pipe</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of a</font>

64
00:02:35,260 --> 00:02:42,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">motorcycle seems like you need a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> very</font>

65
00:02:37,390 --> 00:02:43,660
complicated function to do that and how

66
00:02:42,070 --> 00:02:45,460
do<font color="#E5E5E5"> we do this so machine learning you</font>

67
00:02:43,660 --> 00:02:47,680
<font color="#CCCCCC">know machine learning guys like me say</font>

68
00:02:45,460 --> 00:02:49,240
oh<font color="#E5E5E5"> just feed the data to the learning</font>

69
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:51,310
algorithm and let the<font color="#CCCCCC"> learning algorithm</font>

70
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:52,870
do this job<font color="#CCCCCC"> right when I teach my</font>

71
00:02:51,310 --> 00:02:54,880
machine learning class I draw pictures

72
00:02:52,870 --> 00:02:58,120
like this and this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is just not how it</font>

73
00:02:54,880 --> 00:03:01,570
works oh so let's pick<font color="#E5E5E5"> a couple pixels</font>

74
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:04,150
and let's plot some examples right so

75
00:03:01,570 --> 00:03:06,160
take that image there and because pixel

76
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:09,640
one is relatively dark and pixel to is

77
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:12,640
relatively bright that image you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

78
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:14,230
has has that position in this figure now

79
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:16,210
let's take a different example a

80
00:03:14,230 --> 00:03:17,710
different motorcycle image has a this is

81
00:03:16,210 --> 00:03:19,330
a bright to pixel one and the darker

82
00:03:17,710 --> 00:03:21,370
pixel<font color="#CCCCCC"> too so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that second image has</font>

83
00:03:19,330 --> 00:03:23,530
passed a different<font color="#E5E5E5"> location and then</font>

84
00:03:21,370 --> 00:03:26,410
let's do this for a few negative

85
00:03:23,530 --> 00:03:28,930
examples as well no motorcycles and what

86
00:03:26,410 --> 00:03:30,760
you following is that if you plot a set

87
00:03:28,930 --> 00:03:32,080
of positive and negative motorcycle and

88
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:34,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">not motorcycle images that you're</font>

89
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:35,980
positive negative examples are extremely

90
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:38,410
jumbled together and so if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> feed this</font>

91
00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:41,920
data to you know certainly a linear

92
00:03:38,410 --> 00:03:44,050
classifier it doesn't work so what is

93
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:47,890
<font color="#CCCCCC">done is dead in machine learning is that</font>

94
00:03:44,050 --> 00:03:49,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">we won't want to be nice if you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> could</font>

95
00:03:47,890 --> 00:03:51,490
come up<font color="#E5E5E5"> with what's called a feature</font>

96
00:03:49,810 --> 00:03:53,830
representation if you could write<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

97
00:03:51,490 --> 00:03:55,840
piece of code that<font color="#CCCCCC"> tells you does this</font>

98
00:03:53,830 --> 00:03:59,560
image have handlebars in it does this

99
00:03:55,840 --> 00:04:03,550
image have tires or wheels in it and if

100
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:06,100
you could do that then your data looks

101
00:04:03,550 --> 00:04:08,530
more like<font color="#E5E5E5"> this on the lower right and it</font>

102
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:11,080
then becomes easy much easier<font color="#E5E5E5"> for sale</font>

103
00:04:08,530 --> 00:04:13,060
linear classifier like so vector machine

104
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:14,440
with logistic regression to distinguish

105
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:17,590
the motorcycles from the banal motor

106
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:20,170
signals right but the story goes on so

107
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:21,400
will this in this illustrative example

108
00:04:20,170 --> 00:04:22,690
or saying well whether we could write a

109
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:24,250
piece of code to tell us that<font color="#E5E5E5"> their</font>

110
00:04:22,690 --> 00:04:26,680
handlebars and wheels but we don't

111
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:29,380
actually know how to do<font color="#CCCCCC"> that and so in</font>

112
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:30,790
computer vision what is done is<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually</font>

113
00:04:29,380 --> 00:04:31,960
the following this is how people

114
00:04:30,790 --> 00:04:34,210
actually come up with features in

115
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:36,640
computer vision this is kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of notional</font>

116
00:04:34,210 --> 00:04:37,780
illustrative example but this is what

117
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:40,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm going to do when I take one well as</font>

118
00:04:37,780 --> 00:04:42,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">I go away I'm going to detect edges at</font>

119
00:04:40,630 --> 00:04:45,310
four different orientations so look for

120
00:04:42,970 --> 00:04:49,930
vertical edges horizontal ages 45 degree

121
00:04:45,310 --> 00:04:53,620
ages 135-degree ages and then what this

122
00:04:49,930 --> 00:04:57,460
number<font color="#CCCCCC"> 0 point 7 and the upper right</font>

123
00:04:53,620 --> 00:05:01,450
means right that number is saying that

124
00:04:57,460 --> 00:05:03,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> density of vertical edges in the</font>

125
00:05:01,450 --> 00:05:07,660
upper right-hand quadrant of my image is

126
00:05:03,850 --> 00:05:09,130
0.7 and what and what this<font color="#CCCCCC"> number down</font>

127
00:05:07,660 --> 00:05:11,080
here says is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the density of</font>

128
00:05:09,130 --> 00:05:13,090
horizontal edges you know in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the lower</font>

129
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:18,340
right-hand quadrant of my images 0 point

130
00:05:13,090 --> 00:05:20,110
5 and in case you're getting the sense

131
00:05:18,340 --> 00:05:21,430
that sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of like oh my god what on</font>

132
00:05:20,110 --> 00:05:23,530
earth is going on the air<font color="#CCCCCC"> this seems</font>

133
00:05:21,430 --> 00:05:24,970
hardly complicated how it worked it will

134
00:05:23,530 --> 00:05:26,770
come<font color="#E5E5E5"> up with this piece of code you know</font>

135
00:05:24,970 --> 00:05:28,780
that's that's that's the point and sadly

136
00:05:26,770 --> 00:05:32,110
this is the way the lot of computer

137
00:05:28,780 --> 00:05:34,030
vision is done<font color="#E5E5E5"> today</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so more probably</font>

138
00:05:32,110 --> 00:05:37,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">this notion of a feature representation</font>

139
00:05:34,030 --> 00:05:39,670
is pervasive throughout machine learning

140
00:05:37,210 --> 00:05:41,230
in fact I<font color="#E5E5E5"> guess I live in I live in</font>

141
00:05:39,670 --> 00:05:44,920
Silicon Valley and<font color="#CCCCCC"> if you walk around</font>

142
00:05:41,230 --> 00:05:46,330
Silicon Valley and<font color="#CCCCCC"> look at well where</font>

143
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:47,950
people are spending all the engineering

144
00:05:46,330 --> 00:05:50,530
time is often in coming up with these

145
00:05:47,950 --> 00:05:52,750
feature representations so let's let's

146
00:05:50,530 --> 00:05:56,200
look what's delve deeper right so where

147
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:58,210
do these features come from um since

148
00:05:56,200 --> 00:06:00,160
they're the primary lens through which

149
00:05:58,210 --> 00:06:01,900
our algorithms see the world this gives

150
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:03,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">them a certain important right so how</font>

151
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:05,800
about computer vision oh and then in

152
00:06:03,910 --> 00:06:07,360
facts are interesting and in fact this

153
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:10,060
notion of Peter representations is

154
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:12,700
pervasive you know for vision audio text

155
00:06:10,060 --> 00:06:14,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">even other applications so what do you</font>

156
00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:17,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">get the features from in computer vision</font>

157
00:06:14,590 --> 00:06:19,240
the state-of-the-art answer for where

158
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:22,030
the features come from is that teams of

159
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:23,650
tens hundreds or teams of some of tens

160
00:06:22,030 --> 00:06:25,810
hundreds or maybe thousands of computer

161
00:06:23,650 --> 00:06:27,640
vision researchers have spent decades of

162
00:06:25,810 --> 00:06:29,420
their lives hand engineering features

163
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:32,060

167
00:06:36,170 --> 00:06:42,470
paper in computer vision like lost 15

168
00:06:38,570 --> 00:06:45,740
years and I've read<font color="#CCCCCC"> the paper maybe</font>

169
00:06:42,470 --> 00:06:48,440
about five times now<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I still have no</font>

170
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:52,550
idea what<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> doing this is something</font>

171
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:54,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">so complex piece of code that David</font>

176
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:04,100
pieces of the code in order to come up

177
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:05,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> SIP feature which works pretty</font>

178
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:07,340
well but you know you have to<font color="#CCCCCC"> ask is</font>

179
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:11,180
there a<font color="#E5E5E5"> better way to design features</font>

180
00:07:07,340 --> 00:07:13,970
than this um that's vision how about

181
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:15,440
audio same thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> right teams of tens</font>

182
00:07:13,970 --> 00:07:18,170
hundreds of thousands of audio

183
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:20,540
researchers working on features for

audio FCC is shown on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> upper right</font>

185
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:24,170
that's actually a pretty clever

186
00:07:22,220 --> 00:07:27,230
surprisingly hard to beat but again you

187
00:07:24,170 --> 00:07:29,030
know honestly<font color="#E5E5E5"> to this day I have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a hard</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">language processing text processing</font>

192
00:07:36,290 --> 00:07:42,410
today is unapologetically about finding

193
00:07:39,890 --> 00:07:43,880
better features so think about pauses

194
00:07:42,410 --> 00:07:46,580
right there's a lot of NLP work on

195
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:48,440
<font color="#CCCCCC">parsers um this piece of software that</font>

196
00:07:46,580 --> 00:07:50,150
tells you where the noun phrases are in

197
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:51,890
your sentence I mean why on earth do I

198
00:07:50,150 --> 00:07:53,780
care where<font color="#E5E5E5"> the noun phrases are in my</font>

199
00:07:51,890 --> 00:07:55,940
sentences I really don't need software

200
00:07:53,780 --> 00:07:57,530
to tell me that the only<font color="#CCCCCC"> reason we spend</font>

201
00:07:55,940 --> 00:07:59,360
so much time working on pauses is

202
00:07:57,530 --> 00:08:01,400
because we hope that this will give us

203
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:04,040
useful features to then feed to some

204
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:06,110
later downstream application like

205
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:09,860
anti-spam web search machine translation

206
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:10,910
that we actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> care about so common</font>

207
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:13,310
features is difficult time-consuming

208
00:08:10,910 --> 00:08:15,740
requires expert knowledge and we're

209
00:08:13,310 --> 00:08:17,180
working<font color="#E5E5E5"> with them applications machine</font>

210
00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:19,880
learning you know we spent a long time

211
00:08:17,180 --> 00:08:22,580
there's a way if you look at apply

212
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:24,170
machine learning<font color="#CCCCCC"> where they will walk a</font>

213

new<font color="#E5E5E5"> go the company local people doing</font>

214
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:27,920
apply machine learning this is really

215
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:28,529
what they spend the vast majority of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

216
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:33,749
time<font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font>

217
00:08:28,529 --> 00:08:39,899
is coming with features so can<font color="#E5E5E5"> we do</font>

218
00:08:33,749 --> 00:08:45,600
better so the next<font color="#CCCCCC"> piece in a lot of</font>

219
00:08:39,899 --> 00:08:47,819
<font color="#CCCCCC">deep learning there's a like many</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font>

220
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:50,370
in<font color="#CCCCCC"> very like many of you I tend</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to treat</font>

221
00:08:47,819 --> 00:08:52,860
biological inspiration with a great deal

222
00:08:50,370 --> 00:08:55,649
of caution<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> an even a healthy dose of</font>

223
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:56,999
skepticism but for me a lot of the sum

224
00:08:55,649 --> 00:08:59,309
<font color="#CCCCCC">all of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> my thinking about deep learning</font>

225
00:08:56,999 --> 00:09:02,610
has been taken inspiration from biology

226
00:08:59,309 --> 00:09:04,470
so only share of you you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know some some</font>

227
00:09:02,610 --> 00:09:07,499
cool cool ideas from really by

228
00:09:04,470 --> 00:09:09,360
Washington's variation so turns out

229
00:09:07,499 --> 00:09:12,149
there's a fascinating hypothesis that

230
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:14,249
much of<font color="#CCCCCC"> human intelligence can be</font>

231
00:09:12,149 --> 00:09:16,050
explained by a single learning algorithm

232
00:09:14,249 --> 00:09:18,389
those<font color="#CCCCCC"> calls</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the one learning our</font>

233
00:09:16,050 --> 00:09:21,300
hypothesis let me share with you some

234
00:09:18,389 --> 00:09:23,639
evidence for this right so this one's

235
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:25,800
experiment first done on ferrets in MIT

236
00:09:23,639 --> 00:09:27,689
um that great piece of<font color="#E5E5E5"> brain tissue</font>

237
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:29,579
shown on the slide that's your auditory

238
00:09:27,689 --> 00:09:31,920
cortex<font color="#E5E5E5"> the way that your understanding</font>

239
00:09:29,579 --> 00:09:34,019
my words now is that your ears is

240
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:35,970
routing the sound signal to that piece

241
00:09:34,019 --> 00:09:37,410
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> red brain tissue and this processing</font>

242
00:09:35,970 --> 00:09:38,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">of sound and then that's how you you</font>

243
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:42,059
eventually get to understand what I'm

244
00:09:38,610 --> 00:09:44,519
saying so neuro scientists did the

245
00:09:42,059 --> 00:09:46,589
<font color="#E5E5E5">following experiments which is in cut</font>

246
00:09:44,519 --> 00:09:49,290
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> wire between the ears and the</font>

247
00:09:46,589 --> 00:09:52,079
auditory cortex<font color="#CCCCCC"> and do what's called a</font>

248
00:09:49,290 --> 00:09:54,540
new row rewiring experiment so that

249
00:09:52,079 --> 00:09:58,350
eventually the signal from the<font color="#E5E5E5"> eyes gets</font>

250
00:09:54,540 --> 00:10:00,990
routed to the auditory cortex<font color="#E5E5E5"> then turns</font>

251
00:09:58,350 --> 00:10:03,360
out<font color="#E5E5E5"> they we do this that red piece of</font>

252
00:10:00,990 --> 00:10:05,220
brain tissue she learns to see and this

253
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:07,439
is the word see this has<font color="#E5E5E5"> been replicated</font>

254
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:10,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">in multiple labs on four species of</font>

255
00:10:07,439 --> 00:10:11,850
animals and these animals can quote see

256
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:14,100
in every single sense of the word that I

257
00:10:11,850 --> 00:10:15,149
know how to<font color="#E5E5E5"> use the word see these</font>

258
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:16,800
animals they can do visual

259
00:10:15,149 --> 00:10:18,870
discrimination toss we can look at

260
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:20,220
things and make correct decisions based

261
00:10:18,870 --> 00:10:21,689
on you know an image in front<font color="#E5E5E5"> of them</font>

262
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:25,230
using that rare piece<font color="#CCCCCC"> of brain tissue</font>

263
00:10:21,689 --> 00:10:27,540
another<font color="#CCCCCC"> example this rare piece of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> brain</font>

264
00:10:25,230 --> 00:10:29,910
tissue is your somatosensory cortex is

265
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:31,769
responsible for your sense of touch do a

266
00:10:29,910 --> 00:10:34,920
similar neuro rewiring experiment and

267
00:10:31,769 --> 00:10:38,710
your somatic concerns we call text Lucy

268
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:40,960
um so well generally this is idea that

269
00:10:38,710 --> 00:10:43,390
if the same physical piece of brain

270
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:46,120
tissue right the same physical bit of

271
00:10:43,390 --> 00:10:48,790
your brain can process sight or sound or

272
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:50,950
touch or maybe even other things then

273
00:10:48,790 --> 00:10:53,710
maybe<font color="#CCCCCC"> there is a single</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> learning</font>

274
00:10:50,950 --> 00:10:56,770
algorithm they can process sight or

275
00:10:53,710 --> 00:10:58,570
sound or touch or maybe other<font color="#CCCCCC"> things and</font>

276
00:10:56,770 --> 00:11:00,280
that it can you know discover some

277
00:10:58,570 --> 00:11:01,540
approximation to that learning algorithm

278
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:02,740
when we discover a totally different

279
00:11:01,540 --> 00:11:05,680
algorithm but it accomplishes the same

280
00:11:02,740 --> 00:11:08,290
thing then<font color="#CCCCCC"> that might be a better way</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

there are cases where this<font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't work</font>

321
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:40,760
but I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> to a surprisingly large</font>

322
00:12:38,899 --> 00:12:43,339
extent it's almost as if you can plug in

323
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:45,560
you know not quite any sensor but almost

324
00:12:43,339 --> 00:12:47,450
the large range of sensors on to almost

325
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:50,149
any part of the brain and kind of learn

326
00:12:47,450 --> 00:12:51,589
to do of it so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I want to be cool if we</font>

327
00:12:50,149 --> 00:12:58,220
get a learning algorithm to do the same

328
00:12:51,589 --> 00:13:01,490
so let's see oh let's take a break could

329
00:12:58,220 --> 00:13:04,910
you guys on I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> you now know enough</font>

330
00:13:01,490 --> 00:13:07,490
to work look at the questions 1 through

331
00:13:04,910 --> 00:13:09,350
3 in the handout<font color="#CCCCCC"> do you guys want to</font>

332
00:13:07,490 --> 00:13:10,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">take a few minutes so just write down do</font>

333
00:13:09,350 --> 00:13:13,730
write down what you think is the right

334
00:13:10,550 --> 00:13:15,890
answer and when you've done<font color="#E5E5E5"> so you know</font>

335
00:13:13,730 --> 00:13:17,660
discuss what she wrote down with your

336
00:13:15,890 --> 00:13:23,959
neighbors and and see if you agree or

337
00:13:17,660 --> 00:13:25,910
disagree for<font color="#E5E5E5"> a question</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> one I had d for</font>

338
00:13:23,959 --> 00:13:28,550
question<font color="#CCCCCC"> two I had auditory cortex</font>

339
00:13:25,910 --> 00:13:29,600
learns to see<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to question three I</font>

340
00:13:28,550 --> 00:13:32,029
don't know different people have

341
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:34,100
different ideas I guess I i tend to use

342
00:13:32,029 --> 00:13:35,779
the wording that much of human

343
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:37,310
intelligence can be explained by a

344
00:13:35,779 --> 00:13:38,990
single learning algorithm but there are

345
00:13:37,310 --> 00:13:44,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">lots of other Worthing's that lots of</font>

346
00:13:38,990 --> 00:13:50,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">other ways of describing it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> alright so</font>

347
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:51,589
given this um you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know what are the</font>

348
00:13:50,150 --> 00:13:54,440
implications for machine learning right

349
00:13:51,589 --> 00:13:55,940
so here if we think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that without</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> visual</font>

350
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:57,920
system computes an incredibly

351
00:13:55,940 --> 00:14:00,500
complicated function of the input right

352
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:02,150
it looks all those<font color="#CCCCCC"> numbers</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and those</font>

353
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:06,440
pixel values and tells you<font color="#E5E5E5"> that that's</font>

354
00:14:02,150 --> 00:14:09,320
the motorcycle exhaust pipe and so two

355
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:10,880
approaches that we could try to build

356
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:12,350
such a system as you could try to

357
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:14,300
directly implement this complicated

358
00:14:12,350 --> 00:14:16,970
function which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> what I think of as a</font>

359
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:18,470
hand engineering approach or maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

360
00:14:16,970 --> 00:14:22,010
can try to learn this function instead

361
00:14:18,470 --> 00:14:23,900
right and in<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of a side comment</font>

362
00:14:22,010 --> 00:14:26,300
maybe only for the aficionados of

363
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:28,220
machine learning is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that if you look at</font>

364
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:29,870
a train learning algorithm you know a

365
00:14:28,220 --> 00:14:31,370
learning algorithm after has trained

366
00:14:29,870 --> 00:14:33,350
with all the parameter values there's a

367
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:34,970
very complex thing but the learning

368
00:14:33,350 --> 00:14:36,440
algorithm itself is relatively simple

369
00:14:34,970 --> 00:14:38,900
most learning algorithms

370
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:40,880
<font color="#CCCCCC">striving</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a half a page of pseudocode so</font>

371
00:14:38,900 --> 00:14:42,530
the complexity of the things we're

372
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:44,690
training usually comes from<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

373
00:14:42,530 --> 00:14:46,250
complexity of the data rather than the

374
00:14:44,690 --> 00:14:47,750
complexity of the algorithm and then

375
00:14:46,250 --> 00:14:49,520
that's a good thing because we<font color="#E5E5E5"> know how</font>

376
00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:52,370
to get complex<font color="#E5E5E5"> data you just here which</font>

377
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:54,200
is an image is all around us but coming

378
00:14:52,370 --> 00:14:57,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">up with complex algorithms is hard right</font>

379
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:59,210
so here's a here's a problem that I

380
00:14:57,800 --> 00:15:02,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">guess I post a few years ago which is</font>

381
00:14:59,210 --> 00:15:05,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">you know can we learn a better feature</font>

382
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:08,930
representation for vision or audio or

383
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:10,820
what have you so completely can you come

384
00:15:08,930 --> 00:15:12,380
up with an algorithm they just<font color="#E5E5E5"> examine</font>

385
00:15:10,820 --> 00:15:14,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">examines a bunch of images like these</font>

386
00:15:12,380 --> 00:15:16,340
and automatically comes up with a better

387
00:15:14,660 --> 00:15:20,030
way<font color="#E5E5E5"> to represent images than the raw</font>

388
00:15:16,340 --> 00:15:21,650
pixels and if you can do<font color="#CCCCCC"> that maybe you</font>

389
00:15:20,030 --> 00:15:23,720
can apply<font color="#E5E5E5"> the same algorithm to audio</font>

390
00:15:21,650 --> 00:15:25,970
and have the same algorithm<font color="#CCCCCC"> training</font>

391
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:27,650
along a bunch of audio clips and have it

392
00:15:25,970 --> 00:15:31,550
find a better way<font color="#E5E5E5"> to represent audio</font>

393
00:15:27,650 --> 00:15:33,560
than the raw data<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so let's let's</font>

394
00:15:31,550 --> 00:15:36,230
write<font color="#CCCCCC"> down the mathematical formalism of</font>

395
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:39,200
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem right which</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is given</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a 14 x</font>

396
00:15:36,230 --> 00:15:41,360
14 image<font color="#E5E5E5"> x image patch</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> x one way to</font>

397
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:44,600
represent<font color="#CCCCCC"> the image patch is with a list</font>

398
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:47,390
of 196 roll numbers corresponding to the

399
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:49,370
pixel intensity values the problem one

400
00:15:47,390 --> 00:15:54,560
opposes can we come up<font color="#CCCCCC"> with a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> better</font>

401
00:15:49,370 --> 00:16:00,110
feature vector to represent those pixels

402
00:15:54,560 --> 00:16:01,940
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay and if you can do so then this is</font>

403
00:16:00,110 --> 00:16:04,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">what you can do she has a problem called</font>

404
00:16:01,940 --> 00:16:07,310
a self-taught learning<font color="#CCCCCC"> i guess which is</font>

405
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:09,110
well so in traditional machine learning

406
00:16:07,310 --> 00:16:10,940
right if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to learn to</font>

407
00:16:09,110 --> 00:16:14,420
distinguish<font color="#E5E5E5"> your motorcycles from non</font>

408
00:16:10,940 --> 00:16:16,790
motorcycles you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a training set with</font>

409
00:16:14,420 --> 00:16:18,440
some and this is a pain because there's

410
00:16:16,790 --> 00:16:20,390
a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of work to come</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> up with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot of</font>

411
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:23,690
pictures and motorcycles it was like

412
00:16:20,390 --> 00:16:25,010
tens of thousands<font color="#E5E5E5"> of them so in the</font>

413
00:16:23,690 --> 00:16:27,260
unsupervised feature learning on the

414
00:16:25,010 --> 00:16:30,200
cell for learning problem what you do is

415
00:16:27,260 --> 00:16:32,780
instead we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to give you a large</font>

416
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:35,540
source of unlabeled images will give you

417
00:16:32,780 --> 00:16:38,210
infinite source of unlabeled images

418
00:16:35,540 --> 00:16:40,160
because of the web where we all have an

419
00:16:38,210 --> 00:16:42,920
<font color="#CCCCCC">effectively</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> infinite</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> source of images</font>

420
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:45,019
<font color="#E5E5E5">and the task is</font>

421
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:46,940
can all those random images up there

422
00:16:45,019 --> 00:16:50,060
somehow can pictures of trees and

423
00:16:46,940 --> 00:16:53,240
sunsets and horses and so on can that

424
00:16:50,060 --> 00:16:55,070
help you to do a better job figuring out

425
00:16:53,240 --> 00:17:00,589
that this picture<font color="#E5E5E5"> down here there's a</font>

426
00:16:55,070 --> 00:17:02,420
motorcycle<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay and so one way to do</font>

427
00:17:00,589 --> 00:17:04,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">that is that we have an algorithm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

428
00:17:02,420 --> 00:17:09,380
can look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at these on label images and</font>

429
00:17:04,220 --> 00:17:12,439
learn a much better representation of

430
00:17:09,380 --> 00:17:15,140
images than just the raw pixels<font color="#E5E5E5"> and if</font>

431
00:17:12,439 --> 00:17:17,419
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> superior representation allows us</font>

432
00:17:15,140 --> 00:17:20,569
to then look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at a small label training</font>

433
00:17:17,419 --> 00:17:22,100
set and<font color="#E5E5E5"> if this my superior</font>

434
00:17:20,569 --> 00:17:24,079
representation allows us to<font color="#CCCCCC"> use the</font>

435
00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:25,549
small label training set just do a much

436
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:29,150
better job figuring out what this<font color="#E5E5E5"> test</font>

437
00:17:25,549 --> 00:17:30,710
I'll images ok so i guess in machine

438
00:17:29,150 --> 00:17:33,799
learning there are sort of three

439
00:17:30,710 --> 00:17:35,330
standard<font color="#E5E5E5"> three a few common formalisms</font>

440
00:17:33,799 --> 00:17:37,640
right there's the supervised learning

441
00:17:35,330 --> 00:17:40,669
setting which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is the oldest will</font>

442
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:42,919
standard one that most you best know so

443
00:17:40,669 --> 00:17:44,660
let's<font color="#CCCCCC"> here</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> goes</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the record distinguish</font>

444
00:17:42,919 --> 00:17:47,270
between cars and motorcycles right so in

445
00:17:44,660 --> 00:17:49,220
the standard year old school like 50

446
00:17:47,270 --> 00:17:50,900
year old supervised learning exciting 30

447
00:17:49,220 --> 00:17:52,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">year old supervisor is I think you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> need</font>

448
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:54,080
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> come over</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a large training set up</font>

449
00:17:52,580 --> 00:17:58,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">above the cause</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot of all the cycles</font>

450
00:17:54,080 --> 00:18:01,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay um about 10-15 years ago deciding</font>

451
00:17:58,820 --> 00:18:03,440
Andrew<font color="#E5E5E5"> McCollum Tom Mitchell or maybe</font>

452
00:18:01,220 --> 00:18:05,179
<font color="#E5E5E5">even others before them start to talk</font>

453
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:08,179
about semi-supervised learning the idea

454
00:18:05,179 --> 00:18:10,400
of using unlabeled data and that was

455
00:18:08,179 --> 00:18:14,600
exciting but in semi-supervised learning

456
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:16,520
as is simply conceived um you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

457
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:18,200
ability to use unlabeled data is great

458
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:20,600
but in semi supervised learning

459
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:23,540
typically the unlabeled data is all

460
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:26,540
images or causing motorcycles and it

461
00:18:23,540 --> 00:18:28,460
turns out that this is a semi-supervised

462
00:18:26,540 --> 00:18:30,590
learning this sort of model is not

463
00:18:28,460 --> 00:18:34,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">widely used because it turns out that um</font>

464
00:18:30,590 --> 00:18:36,830
you know rarely do<font color="#CCCCCC"> you have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a data set</font>

465
00:18:34,340 --> 00:18:38,960
of where all the images are get it<font color="#E5E5E5"> cause</font>

466
00:18:36,830 --> 00:18:40,370
all motorcycles and nothing else but<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

467
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:42,770
only thing we're doing is just<font color="#CCCCCC"> missing</font>

468
00:18:40,370 --> 00:18:45,890
the label so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is kind of useful but</font>

469
00:18:42,770 --> 00:18:48,740
isn't why they use whereas in them what

470
00:18:45,890 --> 00:18:50,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">I call self alerting the goal is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to take</font>

471
00:18:48,740 --> 00:18:52,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">you know totally random images that</font>

472
00:18:50,570 --> 00:18:53,450
maybe cause made motorcycles maybe toe

473
00:18:52,490 --> 00:18:56,750
the other<font color="#E5E5E5"> random things</font>

474
00:18:53,450 --> 00:18:59,870
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> two can you can use somehow use this</font>

475
00:18:56,750 --> 00:19:02,659
to learn to distinguish the house and

476
00:18:59,870 --> 00:19:05,600
motorcycles and one weight is why would

477
00:19:02,659 --> 00:19:09,110
I like to think about<font color="#CCCCCC"> it is that you</font>

478
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:11,120
know the first time that<font color="#E5E5E5"> a child sees a</font>

479
00:19:09,110 --> 00:19:12,679
new object someone invents a new vehicle

480
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:16,460
weight the first time that you and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I saw</font>

481
00:19:12,679 --> 00:19:18,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">Segway we learn to recognize the Segway</font>

482
00:19:16,460 --> 00:19:21,260
very quickly<font color="#CCCCCC"> just from seeing it once</font>

483
00:19:18,470 --> 00:19:23,510
and I think the<font color="#E5E5E5"> reason that we learn to</font>

484
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:26,149
recognize a Segway very quickly is

485
00:19:23,510 --> 00:19:28,309
because you're in my visual system prior

486
00:19:26,149 --> 00:19:30,679
to that had had several decades of

487
00:19:28,309 --> 00:19:32,929
experience looking at random natural

488
00:19:30,679 --> 00:19:35,510
images just seeing the world and was by

489
00:19:32,929 --> 00:19:38,480
looking at these random unlabeled images

490
00:19:35,510 --> 00:19:40,370
that allow us that allowed you in my

491
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:41,779
visual system to learn enough about the

492
00:19:40,370 --> 00:19:44,269
structure of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the world to come up</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font>

493
00:19:41,779 --> 00:19:46,549
better features if you will so that the

494
00:19:44,269 --> 00:19:49,010
first time you saw a Segway<font color="#E5E5E5"> you very</font>

495
00:19:46,549 --> 00:19:52,279
quickly learn to recognize what a Segway

496
00:19:49,010 --> 00:19:54,470
is right so just to<font color="#CCCCCC"> make sure you got</font>

497
00:19:52,279 --> 00:19:56,360
this concept could<font color="#E5E5E5"> you please a look at</font>

498
00:19:54,470 --> 00:19:58,070
question<font color="#CCCCCC"> before and just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do that map</font>

499
00:19:56,360 --> 00:19:59,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">this to a new example</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all right so</font>

500
00:19:58,070 --> 00:20:06,110
someone called<font color="#E5E5E5"> the answer well first</font>

501
00:19:59,510 --> 00:20:08,210
first part a PCOD second part and third

502
00:20:06,110 --> 00:20:10,730
part all right also all right that was

503
00:20:08,210 --> 00:20:12,740
easy cool so how do we actually do this

504
00:20:10,730 --> 00:20:15,139
in order to come up with an algorithm to

505
00:20:12,740 --> 00:20:17,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">learn features let's turn one last time</font>

506
00:20:15,139 --> 00:20:20,029
to biological motivation turns out<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

507
00:20:17,330 --> 00:20:21,559
when your brain gets an image the first

508
00:20:20,029 --> 00:20:24,169
thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> it does is look for edges in the</font>

509
00:20:21,559 --> 00:20:25,580
image rights so first stage of visual

510
00:20:24,169 --> 00:20:27,230
processing on the brain is called visual

511
00:20:25,580 --> 00:20:28,519
cortical air review<font color="#E5E5E5"> one I think Jon</font>

512
00:20:27,230 --> 00:20:30,620
might have mentioned this yesterday and

513
00:20:28,519 --> 00:20:32,360
the first<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing it does is look for ages</font>

514
00:20:30,620 --> 00:20:34,610
or lines i'm going to use the term lines

515
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:36,260
and edges interchangeably so in<font color="#CCCCCC"> your</font>

516
00:20:34,610 --> 00:20:38,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">brain right now there's probably a</font>

517
00:20:36,260 --> 00:20:40,850
neuron that is looking for a<font color="#E5E5E5"> 45 degree</font>

518
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:43,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">line 45 degree h like this shown on the</font>

519
00:20:40,850 --> 00:20:46,039
left with the dark region mix too bright

520
00:20:43,580 --> 00:20:47,600
region and there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> probably a different</font>

521
00:20:46,039 --> 00:20:49,429
neuron in your brain right now<font color="#CCCCCC"> there's</font>

522
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:54,919
<font color="#E5E5E5">looking for a vertical line like this</font>

523
00:20:49,429 --> 00:20:57,950
one right here<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so um how can we get</font>

524
00:20:54,919 --> 00:21:00,919
our software to maybe mimic the brain

525
00:20:57,950 --> 00:21:03,230
and also find edges like this what we

526
00:21:00,919 --> 00:21:05,600
don't want to do is code this up by hand

527
00:21:03,230 --> 00:21:07,370
I what I don't want to do is tell the

528
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:09,799
neuroscientist and then you work really

529
00:21:07,370 --> 00:21:12,049
hard<font color="#E5E5E5"> to right hand engineer software the</font>

530
00:21:09,799 --> 00:21:13,250
replicas does I think what's most much

531
00:21:12,049 --> 00:21:14,990
more interesting is we can have an

532
00:21:13,250 --> 00:21:18,620
algorithm learn these things by itself

533
00:21:14,990 --> 00:21:20,900
and that there is<font color="#E5E5E5"> such an algorithm is</font>

534
00:21:18,620 --> 00:21:23,360
very old ones like a what 16 year old

535
00:21:20,900 --> 00:21:25,640
was out now do 20 thousand a<font color="#E5E5E5"> few</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> called</font>

536
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:27,559
sparse coding you<font color="#E5E5E5"> talked about this a</font>

537
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:29,090
bit yesterday did you write cool so

538
00:21:27,559 --> 00:21:32,780
<font color="#CCCCCC">there we go</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for this very quickly even a</font>

539
00:21:29,090 --> 00:21:35,030
small scolding was obviously conceived

540
00:21:32,780 --> 00:21:37,160
as like a theoretical neuroscience model

541
00:21:35,030 --> 00:21:38,780
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know Bruno's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> heusen will tell you</font>

542
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:40,309
<font color="#CCCCCC">right he never envisioned that this</font>

543
00:21:38,780 --> 00:21:42,410
would be<font color="#E5E5E5"> used as a machine learning</font>

544
00:21:40,309 --> 00:21:44,570
algorithm this is like a theoretical

545
00:21:42,410 --> 00:21:47,330
neuroscience result used to try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

546
00:21:44,570 --> 00:21:49,010
<font color="#CCCCCC">explain you know computations in the</font>

547
00:21:47,330 --> 00:21:52,549
<font color="#E5E5E5">brain or something like that right and</font>

548
00:21:49,010 --> 00:21:55,490
this is how the album works is an

549
00:21:52,549 --> 00:21:57,620
unsupervised learning algorithm so the

550
00:21:55,490 --> 00:22:01,910
way where else is repeated a set of em

551
00:21:57,620 --> 00:22:05,240
images x 1 x 2 up to X M so each input

552
00:22:01,910 --> 00:22:08,390
example is and let's say an N by n

553
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:11,720
matrix yo go like a 14 x 14 image patch

554
00:22:08,390 --> 00:22:13,640
what's<font color="#E5E5E5"> fast coding does is it learns the</font>

555
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:16,790
dictionary of basis functions Phi 1 Phi

556
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:19,040
2 up to<font color="#E5E5E5"> 5 K such that each of your</font>

557
00:22:16,790 --> 00:22:21,410
training images<font color="#E5E5E5"> X subject to the</font>

558
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:23,780
constraint that the AJ's are mostly<font color="#CCCCCC"> zero</font>

559
00:22:21,410 --> 00:22:26,570
spots in and the way this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is implemented</font>

560
00:22:23,780 --> 00:22:27,480
is on where they<font color="#CCCCCC"> are l one constraint</font>

561
00:22:26,570 --> 00:22:28,830
we're both

562
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:31,140
you know minimize<font color="#CCCCCC"> the sum of absolute</font>

563
00:22:28,830 --> 00:22:37,470
value terms on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> only coefficients</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> AJ</font>

564
00:22:31,140 --> 00:22:42,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay the sparsity penalty sir and so if</font>

565
00:22:37,470 --> 00:22:44,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">you do this then on well they I think</font>

566
00:22:42,180 --> 00:22:47,940
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the only equation I have for</font>

567
00:22:44,460 --> 00:22:54,930
this first hour so I hope you enjoyed it

568
00:22:47,940 --> 00:22:58,410
so same thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> in pictures if you train</font>

569
00:22:54,930 --> 00:22:59,970
sports clothing on natural images every

570
00:22:58,410 --> 00:23:01,740
single time you're on it they'll learn

571
00:22:59,970 --> 00:23:04,500
the set of basis functions that look a

572
00:23:01,740 --> 00:23:06,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">lot like the edge protectors that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

573
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:09,360
know we believe visual protocol error<font color="#E5E5E5"> v1</font>

574
00:23:06,510 --> 00:23:12,330
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> looking for and then given a test</font>

575
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:14,730
example given a test image X right what

576
00:23:12,330 --> 00:23:18,540
what what it will do is<font color="#E5E5E5"> it will select</font>

577
00:23:14,730 --> 00:23:20,250
out let's say three all<font color="#CCCCCC"> of my 64 basis</font>

578
00:23:18,540 --> 00:23:23,190
functions here and it<font color="#CCCCCC"> will take that</font>

579
00:23:20,250 --> 00:23:26,250
test example and explain it or decompose

580
00:23:23,190 --> 00:23:29,310
it into a linear<font color="#CCCCCC"> combination of in this</font>

581
00:23:26,250 --> 00:23:33,690
case just three out of 64 of my basis

582
00:23:29,310 --> 00:23:35,580
functions<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so speaking loosely</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font>

583
00:23:33,690 --> 00:23:37,320
album has quote invented edge detection

584
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:39,150
right the album was free to choose

585
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:41,010
absolutely any basis functions at once

586
00:23:39,150 --> 00:23:43,170
but it shows but you know if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you run it</font>

587
00:23:41,010 --> 00:23:44,700
every time it chooses to learn basis

588
00:23:43,170 --> 00:23:49,290
functions that look like these edges and

589
00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:54,390
what this decomposition says is that

590
00:23:49,290 --> 00:23:59,340
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> image</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> x is 0.8 times</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> H number 36</font>

591
00:23:54,390 --> 00:24:03,450
plus OH point<font color="#E5E5E5"> 3 times H number 42 plus</font>

592
00:23:59,340 --> 00:24:05,640
0.5 times H number 63<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so if you</font>

593
00:24:03,450 --> 00:24:08,130
will this is saying this is now<font color="#CCCCCC"> T</font>

594
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:10,680
<font color="#CCCCCC">composed the image in terms of what</font>

595
00:24:08,130 --> 00:24:13,170
edges appear in this<font color="#CCCCCC"> image and this</font>

596
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:15,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">gives a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> high-level more succinct more</font>

597
00:24:13,170 --> 00:24:17,370
compact representation of the image and

598
00:24:15,060 --> 00:24:18,750
also probably a more useful one right

599
00:24:17,370 --> 00:24:20,310
because it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> more useful to know where</font>

600
00:24:18,750 --> 00:24:25,200
the edges are in the image that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know</font>

601
00:24:20,310 --> 00:24:27,840
where the pixels are moreover this gives

602
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:30,390
us a alternative way to<font color="#E5E5E5"> represent the</font>

603
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:33,210
image instead of representing the image

604
00:24:30,390 --> 00:24:35,080
patch using a list of 196 pixel values

605
00:24:33,210 --> 00:24:38,019
we can instead

606
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:39,580
using this vector of numbers a 1 through

607
00:24:38,019 --> 00:24:41,890
a 64 these are the coefficients

608
00:24:39,580 --> 00:24:43,960
multiplying it to the basis functions<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

609
00:24:41,890 --> 00:24:46,779
just a few more examples so the method

610
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:48,279
indentation attention those represent an

611
00:24:46,779 --> 00:24:53,529
image in terms I just appear in it and

612
00:24:48,279 --> 00:24:55,870
it turns out that a funeral scientists

613
00:24:53,529 --> 00:24:57,970
have done that had to invent a<font color="#CCCCCC"> chef have</font>

614
00:24:55,870 --> 00:25:02,409
done quantitative comparison between

615
00:24:57,970 --> 00:25:06,100
sparse coding and<font color="#E5E5E5"> 0 and visual cortical</font>

616
00:25:02,409 --> 00:25:08,230
area v1 and found that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know it's not</font>

617
00:25:06,100 --> 00:25:10,600
as by no means a perfect explanation of

618
00:25:08,230 --> 00:25:13,149
visual to everyone but but it matches of

619
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:17,529
unknown<font color="#E5E5E5"> so surprisingly well on not all</font>

620
00:25:13,149 --> 00:25:21,159
but on many dimensions so that's vision

621
00:25:17,529 --> 00:25:22,929
how about other input modalities so this

622
00:25:21,159 --> 00:25:25,029
is a slide that got from Evan Smith from

623
00:25:22,929 --> 00:25:28,059
his PhD thesis work with Michael Ricky

624
00:25:25,029 --> 00:25:30,669
so what Evan did was he applies false

625
00:25:28,059 --> 00:25:34,600
coding to audio data and what I've shown

626
00:25:30,669 --> 00:25:36,700
here is 20 basis functions learned by

627
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:39,370
sparse coding when trained on natural

628
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:43,960
sounds<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok so this is a grid of 5 by 4</font>

629
00:25:39,370 --> 00:25:47,019
you know what 5 by 4 the lower audio

630
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:48,429
<font color="#CCCCCC">clips i guess audio basis functions so</font>

631
00:25:47,019 --> 00:25:53,500
this 20 basis functions<font color="#E5E5E5"> learned by</font>

632
00:25:48,429 --> 00:25:56,139
sparse coding um what he did was he then

633
00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:58,210
went to the cat or the tree system since

634
00:25:56,139 --> 00:25:59,919
the biologists in Boston had been you

635
00:25:58,210 --> 00:26:01,960
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> using electro recordings to figure</font>

636
00:25:59,919 --> 00:26:05,799
out what early auditory processing and

637
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:08,230
the cat does and for you should these 20

638
00:26:05,799 --> 00:26:10,539
things learned by his algorithm he found

639
00:26:08,230 --> 00:26:13,600
the closest match in the biological data

640
00:26:10,539 --> 00:26:17,919
and the closest matches are shown over

641
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:20,110
the in red ok so the same algorithm the

642
00:26:17,919 --> 00:26:21,789
only one<font color="#E5E5E5"> hand</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> gives a you know decent</font>

643
00:26:20,110 --> 00:26:23,799
explanation for early visual processing

644
00:26:21,789 --> 00:26:26,980
and all the other hand juice maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> a you</font>

645
00:26:23,799 --> 00:26:29,049
know by no means perfect but but the

646
00:26:26,980 --> 00:26:30,820
reason we expect some explanation to

647
00:26:29,049 --> 00:26:34,720
relieve it auditory processing as well

648
00:26:30,820 --> 00:26:37,419
and it turns out you can do a similar

649
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:39,250
study on them or the somatosensory

650
00:26:37,419 --> 00:26:40,970
processing as well this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is work done by</font>

651
00:26:39,250 --> 00:26:44,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">Andrew</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> cycle</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Stanford</font>

652
00:26:40,970 --> 00:26:45,440
where he collected touch data<font color="#CCCCCC"> how</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do you</font>

653
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:48,440
call it<font color="#E5E5E5"> touch data right so the way that</font>

654
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:50,539
dumb Andrew Andrew<font color="#E5E5E5"> sacks did it was um</font>

655
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:51,770
you know so we hold things<font color="#E5E5E5"> of our hands</font>

656
00:26:50,539 --> 00:26:53,390
all the time when I'm holding<font color="#E5E5E5"> this thing</font>

657
00:26:51,770 --> 00:26:56,059
but how do you<font color="#E5E5E5"> how do you actually</font>

658
00:26:53,390 --> 00:26:58,549
collect data for how I'm holding it so

659
00:26:56,059 --> 00:27:02,000
the way Andrew<font color="#E5E5E5"> sacks did it was um he</font>

660
00:26:58,549 --> 00:27:03,890
took a glove oh and he took an object

661
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:05,809
and he sprayed talcum powder all over

662
00:27:03,890 --> 00:27:09,200
the object<font color="#CCCCCC"> and then when you take a</font>

663
00:27:05,809 --> 00:27:11,929
glove and you hope this object and then

664
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:14,900
you let go<font color="#E5E5E5"> the pattern of talcum powder</font>

665
00:27:11,929 --> 00:27:16,850
you know on your glove tells you where

666
00:27:14,900 --> 00:27:19,070
you came into<font color="#E5E5E5"> contact with the object</font>

667
00:27:16,850 --> 00:27:20,809
<font color="#E5E5E5">and moreover the density of talcum</font>

668
00:27:19,070 --> 00:27:24,530
powder actually corresponds<font color="#E5E5E5"> a little bit</font>

669
00:27:20,809 --> 00:27:26,150
to the to the pressure and and<font color="#E5E5E5"> not sure</font>

670
00:27:24,530 --> 00:27:29,240
why he did this but<font color="#CCCCCC"> dumb he then</font>

671
00:27:26,150 --> 00:27:30,919
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually found so so what type of</font>

672
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:32,690
objects to people holder I all we don't

673
00:27:30,919 --> 00:27:35,179
<font color="#E5E5E5">know so here collecting data you want to</font>

674
00:27:32,690 --> 00:27:36,650
be representative of what animals do so

675
00:27:35,179 --> 00:27:39,860
fortunately it turns out that there were

676
00:27:36,650 --> 00:27:42,350
two biologists that has spent about a

677
00:27:39,860 --> 00:27:44,600
year on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the of their lives sitting on</font>

678
00:27:42,350 --> 00:27:47,630
some Island watching monkeys and

679
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:50,270
carefully documenting every single way

680
00:27:47,630 --> 00:27:52,400
that monkeys pick up different things so

681
00:27:50,270 --> 00:27:57,289
thank<font color="#E5E5E5"> God I'm up computer sciences right</font>

682
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:59,450
and so Andrew<font color="#E5E5E5"> sacks you know took that</font>

683
00:27:57,289 --> 00:28:01,549
distribution of data and he wearing his

684
00:27:59,450 --> 00:28:03,620
glove picked up objects using the same

685
00:28:01,549 --> 00:28:05,330
distribution of drawers as was

686
00:28:03,620 --> 00:28:10,100
documented in these monkeys on an island

687
00:28:05,330 --> 00:28:12,260
oh and that was his data I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

688
00:28:10,100 --> 00:28:16,820
story was pretty fun but totally

689
00:28:12,260 --> 00:28:18,620
unnecessary oh but<font color="#CCCCCC"> Carlos are usually</font>

690
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:21,500
goes you know so training training on

691
00:28:18,620 --> 00:28:22,970
data like this that turns out that you

692
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:26,419
learn basis functions using sparse

693
00:28:22,970 --> 00:28:29,330
coding<font color="#E5E5E5"> that are I should say by no means</font>

694
00:28:26,419 --> 00:28:31,520
a perfect match<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> one to what is known</font>

695
00:28:29,330 --> 00:28:33,590
to what is believed to happen in

696
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:35,330
somatosensory cortex<font color="#E5E5E5"> but this may be a</font>

697
00:28:33,590 --> 00:28:43,010
surprisingly good match

698
00:28:35,330 --> 00:28:47,210
dimensions right so that's fast coding

699
00:28:43,010 --> 00:28:51,800
um and let me could you<font color="#E5E5E5"> take could you</font>

700
00:28:47,210 --> 00:28:58,850
do a five and six on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the handle so</font>

701
00:28:51,800 --> 00:29:00,980
what's the answer four five and six wait

702
00:28:58,850 --> 00:29:05,210
what's wait once what is most actually

703
00:29:00,980 --> 00:29:08,600
where was it for six again<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay come on</font>

704
00:29:05,210 --> 00:29:10,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">all right be right</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all right</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> cool let's</font>

705
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:11,690
exert the right so the bases are the

706
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:13,010
same for every image but is the

707
00:29:11,690 --> 00:29:14,810
coefficients they want to rake eight

708
00:29:13,010 --> 00:29:21,160
other features for the specific image

709
00:29:14,810 --> 00:29:21,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay um all right great</font>

710
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:31,160
so that's sparse coding and it turns out

711
00:29:28,340 --> 00:29:34,190
that on the different ways<font color="#CCCCCC"> to implement</font>

712
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:36,440
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> sparse coding and what what I</font>

713
00:29:34,190 --> 00:29:39,830
just talked about<font color="#E5E5E5"> was maybe the the</font>

714
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:42,230
original way by ourselves<font color="#CCCCCC"> net view in</font>

715
00:29:39,830 --> 00:29:43,970
1986<font color="#CCCCCC"> there much food there there</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

716
00:29:42,230 --> 00:29:45,740
different ways now<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> young mother</font>

717
00:29:43,970 --> 00:29:47,090
talked about encoded ecole architectures

718
00:29:45,740 --> 00:29:49,340
I'll talk a bit more about<font color="#CCCCCC"> that later</font>

719
00:29:47,090 --> 00:29:53,330
today but i think this intuition of

720
00:29:49,340 --> 00:29:57,140
learning space features has been kind of

721
00:29:53,330 --> 00:29:59,090
key for is one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the ideas i guess that</font>

722
00:29:57,140 --> 00:30:01,760
allows<font color="#CCCCCC"> us to learn very useful because</font>

723
00:29:59,090 --> 00:30:03,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">even from unlabeled data come back to</font>

724
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:05,900
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> later as well there are there other</font>

725
00:30:03,710 --> 00:30:08,000
ways to do it if any of<font color="#E5E5E5"> you are familiar</font>

726
00:30:05,900 --> 00:30:09,890
with ica actually how many of you have

727
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:12,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">heard of the ica independent components</font>

728
00:30:09,890 --> 00:30:15,020
out<font color="#E5E5E5"> as I oh cool all of you awesome so</font>

729
00:30:12,650 --> 00:30:17,570
it turns out that there's a you know

730
00:30:15,020 --> 00:30:20,150
deep mathematical relationship between

731
00:30:17,570 --> 00:30:21,530
<font color="#CCCCCC">ica and sparse coding that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the turns out</font>

732
00:30:20,150 --> 00:30:24,680
the two albums are doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> something very</font>

733
00:30:21,530 --> 00:30:27,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">similar for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> me personally these days I</font>

734
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:28,850
tend to use the<font color="#CCCCCC"> ica version so sparse</font>

735
00:30:27,020 --> 00:30:31,160
coding rather than the version<font color="#E5E5E5"> I just</font>

736
00:30:28,850 --> 00:30:32,990
talked about but later today also<font color="#CCCCCC"> talk</font>

737
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:35,060
about about sparse altering colors<font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font>

738
00:30:32,990 --> 00:30:38,270
different ways<font color="#E5E5E5"> of learning sparse</font>

739
00:30:35,060 --> 00:30:41,480
features we get to that later but so

740
00:30:38,270 --> 00:30:43,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">what do you do instead</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of you know you</font>

741
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:45,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">just described is you know one layer</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

742
00:30:43,460 --> 00:30:47,330
one of these sparse feature learning our

743
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:48,800
rooms may be sparse coding maybe as

744
00:30:47,330 --> 00:30:53,660
possible to encode there may be a sparse

745
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:55,940
VPN<font color="#CCCCCC"> on spots rbm and turns out what you</font>

746
00:30:53,660 --> 00:30:57,740
can do really building on a jet engines

747
00:30:55,940 --> 00:30:59,870
work what<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can do is recursively</font>

748
00:30:57,740 --> 00:31:04,670
apply this procedure where instead<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

749
00:30:59,870 --> 00:31:06,920
just going<font color="#E5E5E5"> from pixels to images excuse</font>

750
00:31:04,670 --> 00:31:11,660
me pixels to edges you can recursively

751
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:13,310
apply this procedure and you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

752
00:31:11,660 --> 00:31:15,560
as you can group together pixels to form

753
00:31:13,310 --> 00:31:17,720
agency in group together edges to form

754
00:31:15,560 --> 00:31:19,820
combinations of edges and group together

755
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:22,580
combinations of edges to form higher

756
00:31:19,820 --> 00:31:25,070
level features so let<font color="#E5E5E5"> me show an example</font>

757
00:31:22,580 --> 00:31:27,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">that this is an example run by Hall</font>

758
00:31:25,070 --> 00:31:29,799
actually it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Michigan professor</font>

759
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:34,239
but what<font color="#E5E5E5"> ho laughter</font>

760
00:31:29,799 --> 00:31:38,049
she trained one layer<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ooze expose DBN</font>

761
00:31:34,239 --> 00:31:40,570
and first layer you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> Alfred mercy</font>

762
00:31:38,049 --> 00:31:42,850
group together pixels for mages another

763
00:31:40,570 --> 00:31:45,639
level up learn significant<font color="#E5E5E5"> edges to form</font>

764
00:31:42,850 --> 00:31:47,499
models of object parts right so does

765
00:31:45,639 --> 00:31:49,570
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> oh i should say this this was an</font>

766
00:31:47,499 --> 00:31:51,460
example<font color="#CCCCCC"> of sparse coding train just on</font>

767
00:31:49,570 --> 00:31:54,220
pictures of faces so the entire dataset

768
00:31:51,460 --> 00:31:57,039
was pictures of faces right and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm</font>

769
00:31:54,220 --> 00:31:59,440
requesting you apply this the next level

770
00:31:57,039 --> 00:32:03,429
up and<font color="#E5E5E5"> learn more complete models of</font>

771
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:06,759
faces so let<font color="#E5E5E5"> me make sure that this</font>

772
00:32:03,429 --> 00:32:08,710
visualization makes sense right um when

773
00:32:06,759 --> 00:32:11,080
I have this<font color="#E5E5E5"> little square here shown</font>

774
00:32:08,710 --> 00:32:12,639
here what<font color="#E5E5E5"> this little red what does</font>

775
00:32:11,080 --> 00:32:14,950
little square means is that I have

776
00:32:12,639 --> 00:32:16,869
learned a neuron in the first level that

777
00:32:14,950 --> 00:32:20,980
is looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> for a vertical edge like that</font>

778
00:32:16,869 --> 00:32:22,600
one<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay going one level up and and and</font>

779
00:32:20,980 --> 00:32:25,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">I've shown all these rectangles the same</font>

780
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:26,649
size but higher up features are actually

781
00:32:25,090 --> 00:32:28,179
looking at bigger regions of the image

782
00:32:26,649 --> 00:32:30,249
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just a resize all look the</font>

783
00:32:28,179 --> 00:32:31,509
same but one level up this is actually

784
00:32:30,249 --> 00:32:33,549

785
00:32:31,509 --> 00:32:36,879

rectangle here means that at<font color="#CCCCCC"> that next</font>

788
00:32:39,190 --> 00:32:44,409
detect eyes that look like that great

789
00:32:42,129 --> 00:32:46,090
and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the highest level you know</font>

790
00:32:44,409 --> 00:32:48,549
if you look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the upper left most</font>

791
00:32:46,090 --> 00:32:49,960
square say with that visualization is

792
00:32:48,549 --> 00:32:52,960
showing<font color="#CCCCCC"> that there's a neuron that has</font>

793
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:57,159
learned to detect faces that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> look</font>

794
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:59,739
look a bit like that person<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay if you</font>

795
00:32:57,159 --> 00:33:03,429
train the same algorithm<font color="#E5E5E5"> on different</font>

796
00:32:59,739 --> 00:33:05,320
object classes you end up<font color="#E5E5E5"> with different</font>

797
00:33:03,429 --> 00:33:07,509
decompositions of different object

798
00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:09,999
classes into different object parts then

799
00:33:07,509 --> 00:33:12,549
more complete models of objects if you

800
00:33:09,999 --> 00:33:14,350
train the algorithm on a mix of four

801
00:33:12,549 --> 00:33:16,269
different classes of objects so there's

802
00:33:14,350 --> 00:33:18,129
an algorithm trained on a data set that

803
00:33:16,269 --> 00:33:21,730
includes cause faces bikes and airplanes

804
00:33:18,129 --> 00:33:23,559
then you know you end up with at the

805
00:33:21,730 --> 00:33:26,049
mid-level you get features that shared

806
00:33:23,559 --> 00:33:30,909
among the different object classes where

807
00:33:26,049 --> 00:33:33,249
I don't know maybe what I guess are we

808
00:33:30,909 --> 00:33:35,109
caused a motor bike expo<font color="#E5E5E5"> 5th wheel tire</font>

809
00:33:33,249 --> 00:33:37,239
like shapes or your features that kind

810
00:33:35,109 --> 00:33:38,470
of share between multiple parts and then

811
00:33:37,239 --> 00:33:39,990
the highest level you get object

812
00:33:38,470 --> 00:33:53,520
specific features

813
00:33:39,990 --> 00:33:56,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay yeah I see yes there is there's a</font>

814
00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:57,750
point so because<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the nature of the</font>

815
00:33:56,250 --> 00:34:01,710
visualization<font color="#E5E5E5"> I showed them as though</font>

816
00:33:57,750 --> 00:34:03,240
images but yeah it if there's some

00:34:01,710 --> 00:34:06,990
amounts of<font color="#E5E5E5"> Indians that's hard to</font>

818
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:09,690
visualize it oh<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> remember i have a</font>

819
00:34:06,990 --> 00:34:11,700

more carefully document<font color="#E5E5E5"> the invariant</font>

821
00:34:11,700 --> 00:34:18,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">zones have a better example later okay</font>

822
00:34:15,030 --> 00:34:20,159
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> was this good for um when you went</font>

823
00:34:18,330 --> 00:34:22,470
when<font color="#CCCCCC"> you hear</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> your research isn't deep</font>

824
00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:24,659

825
00:34:22,470 --> 00:34:26,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">like y'all in me and geoff hinton is how</font>

826
00:34:24,659 --> 00:34:28,230
long stories I'd use but you know so<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

827
00:34:26,850 --> 00:34:30,659
can learn features so what is<font color="#E5E5E5"> it good</font>

828
00:34:28,230 --> 00:34:32,310
for well<font color="#CCCCCC"> turns out the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Hollywood to</font>

829
00:34:30,659 --> 00:34:34,800
benchmark will stand the benchmark in

830
00:34:32,310 --> 00:34:37,470
computer vision where the task is to

831
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:39,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">wash a short video clip and decide</font>

832

someone's running the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Badger activities</font>

837
00:34:45,720 --> 00:34:48,600
like the theater<font color="#E5E5E5"> computer vision has</font>

838
00:34:47,220 --> 00:34:51,570
tried out many different combinations

839
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:53,310
that features last year hopefully<font color="#E5E5E5"> soon</font>

840
00:34:51,570 --> 00:34:55,169
as standard found that by learning

he was able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to significantly outperform</font>

843
00:34:57,660 --> 00:35:03,810
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> previous day we are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> right how</font>

844
00:35:01,410 --> 00:35:06,090
about audio<font color="#E5E5E5"> it turns out you can apply</font>

845
00:35:03,810 --> 00:35:07,680
similar ideas to<font color="#CCCCCC"> audio</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so this is a</font>

846
00:35:06,090 --> 00:35:09,720
spectrogram which is a different

847
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:13,350
representation for audio you can take

848
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:16,140
slices of spectrograms and apply sparse

849
00:35:13,350 --> 00:35:19,830
coding to that it turns out we do this

850
00:35:16,140 --> 00:35:21,300
then on this is a dictionary<font color="#E5E5E5"> of basis</font>

851
00:35:19,830 --> 00:35:24,000
functions learning for speech i guess

852
00:35:21,300 --> 00:35:26,550
i'm not<font color="#CCCCCC"> an</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> excellent speech but in</font>

853
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:29,630
impervia probably a slightly optimistic

854
00:35:26,550 --> 00:35:32,150
as a

855
00:35:29,630 --> 00:35:34,220
reading of these you know the basis

856
00:35:32,150 --> 00:35:36,650
functions learn by sparse coding

857
00:35:34,220 --> 00:35:38,420
correspond roughly to phonemes is a

858
00:35:36,650 --> 00:35:41,509
slightly optimistic interpretation i

859
00:35:38,420 --> 00:35:43,220
should say and so but if under this

860
00:35:41,509 --> 00:35:45,109
slightly optimistic interpretation when

861
00:35:43,220 --> 00:35:48,140
say informally that sparse coding has

862
00:35:45,109 --> 00:35:49,849
learned to decompose speech data you

863
00:35:48,140 --> 00:35:51,319
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> very loosely into it because the</font>

864
00:35:49,849 --> 00:35:55,069
phonemes to the pier in speech and

865
00:35:51,319 --> 00:35:56,990
moreover you can take this recursively

866
00:35:55,069 --> 00:35:58,640
apply this idea just<font color="#CCCCCC"> as we saw earlier</font>

867
00:35:56,990 --> 00:36:01,430
to build higher and higher level

868
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:04,579
features and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i guess a few</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> years ago oh</font>

869
00:36:01,430 --> 00:36:07,549
<font color="#E5E5E5">how likely so against</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the timid</font>

870
00:36:04,579 --> 00:36:10,190
benchmark is a data said that many

871
00:36:07,549 --> 00:36:11,990
speech researchers work on this is one

872
00:36:10,190 --> 00:36:15,079
of those<font color="#CCCCCC"> data sets where you know if you</font>

873
00:36:11,990 --> 00:36:21,799
do point<font color="#E5E5E5"> one percent better you write a</font>

874
00:36:15,079 --> 00:36:24,920
paper and<font color="#E5E5E5"> a few</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> years ago homeland was</font>

875
00:36:21,799 --> 00:36:26,240
able to you know make what correspondent

876
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:28,220
so I think worked out something like

877
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:30,140
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> two-thirds of a decade</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> word for</font>

878
00:36:28,220 --> 00:36:33,079

879
00:36:30,140 --> 00:36:34,849
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> might learn even this chart is</font>

880
00:36:33,079 --> 00:36:36,500
outdated i made this child<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think back</font>

881
00:36:34,849 --> 00:36:38,779
when pauillac was publishing this paper

882
00:36:36,500 --> 00:36:40,789
since publishing this paper geoff hinton

883
00:36:38,779 --> 00:36:44,960
and others have surpassed is also using

884
00:36:40,789 --> 00:36:47,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">deep learning techniques right um and</font>

885
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:49,880
then as referring as was preparing this

886
00:36:47,450 --> 00:36:53,150
talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> i better for practice I ask my</font>

887
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:55,609
students to help<font color="#E5E5E5"> me put together a chart</font>

888
00:36:53,150 --> 00:36:57,980
of the sorcerer results where you know

889
00:36:55,609 --> 00:36:59,720
we or others or whatever holders through

890
00:36:57,980 --> 00:37:01,819
the odd benchmark result using deep

891
00:36:59,720 --> 00:37:04,430
learning and there were surprisingly

892
00:37:01,819 --> 00:37:06,460
many of them from<font color="#E5E5E5"> us Stanford from other</font>

893
00:37:04,430 --> 00:37:09,609
groups

894
00:37:06,460 --> 00:37:11,740
I've I say yeah I worked a machine

895
00:37:09,609 --> 00:37:17,170
learning for a long time I've never<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

896
00:37:11,740 --> 00:37:18,970
my life seen anyone technology not go

897
00:37:17,170 --> 00:37:20,830
over benchmarks like this quickly is

898
00:37:18,970 --> 00:37:22,150
this the whole<font color="#CCCCCC"> view the deep learning is</font>

899
00:37:20,830 --> 00:37:24,280
like knocking over benchmark like

900
00:37:22,150 --> 00:37:26,320
nobody's business um there's actually a

901
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:28,450
lot more than<font color="#E5E5E5"> fits on one slide I think</font>

902
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:30,910
if I put all the ones I'm aware of it be

903
00:37:28,450 --> 00:37:33,760
about three slides like this right

904
00:37:30,910 --> 00:37:35,920
what's left<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be done right so and I</font>

905
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:38,230
know that some of you are you know here

906
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:39,790
because uh<font color="#E5E5E5"> you want to learn how to</font>

907
00:37:38,230 --> 00:37:41,890
apply these things and I know some of

908
00:37:39,790 --> 00:37:43,930
you are here because you might be even

909
00:37:41,890 --> 00:37:45,640
interested<font color="#E5E5E5"> in doing research yourselves</font>

910
00:37:43,930 --> 00:37:49,060
and writing research papers yourselves

911
00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:50,290
in deep learning and future learning so

912
00:37:49,060 --> 00:37:51,910
I want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> share of you I'll do this</font>

913
00:37:50,290 --> 00:37:55,119
later to talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> more about this later</font>

914
00:37:51,910 --> 00:37:58,119
<font color="#CCCCCC">there as</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> well share of you what I think</font>

915
00:37:55,119 --> 00:38:00,310
of as a as a good way as one as one of

916
00:37:58,119 --> 00:38:02,619
many promising directions in which to

917
00:38:00,310 --> 00:38:05,380
you know take research for for deep

918
00:38:02,619 --> 00:38:08,589
learning I think that's a scaling up so

919
00:38:05,380 --> 00:38:10,180
I'm happy<font color="#E5E5E5"> have we build effective deep</font>

920
00:38:08,589 --> 00:38:13,630
learning algorithms right how do we get

921
00:38:10,180 --> 00:38:15,160
these animals work well well in fact how

922
00:38:13,630 --> 00:38:17,380
do you build effective machine learning

923
00:38:15,160 --> 00:38:19,150
algorithms you know so let's not back in

924
00:38:17,380 --> 00:38:21,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">history right about 20 years ago oh</font>

925
00:38:19,150 --> 00:38:22,900
there were<font color="#CCCCCC"> east debates about you know</font>

926
00:38:21,190 --> 00:38:24,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">where these different supervised</font>

927
00:38:22,900 --> 00:38:25,869
learning algorithms so no feature

928
00:38:24,310 --> 00:38:27,609
learning yourself<font color="#E5E5E5"> alone neighbors</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> will</font>

929
00:38:25,869 --> 00:38:29,140
be supervised learning algorithms and

930
00:38:27,609 --> 00:38:31,450
they use<font color="#E5E5E5"> be all these debates about you</font>

931
00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:37,089
know is this new album better is my

932
00:38:31,450 --> 00:38:39,490
album better so um Michelle banco and

933
00:38:37,089 --> 00:38:42,099
<font color="#E5E5E5">eric bro did one of the studies that</font>

934
00:38:39,490 --> 00:38:44,349
most influenced my thinking where they

935
00:38:42,099 --> 00:38:46,869
took maybe four of the city of the art

936
00:38:44,349 --> 00:38:48,940
learning algorithms of the day I guess

937
00:38:46,869 --> 00:38:51,580
back in 2001's<font color="#CCCCCC"> ians were not yet popular</font>

938
00:38:48,940 --> 00:38:52,660
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> they didn't actually study SVM's but</font>

939
00:38:51,580 --> 00:38:55,060
they took<font color="#E5E5E5"> a natural language processing</font>

940
00:38:52,660 --> 00:38:58,000
costs on which they had a effectively

941
00:38:55,060 --> 00:39:01,450
unlimited source of labeled data and

942
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:04,390
they train for learning algorithms and

943
00:39:01,450 --> 00:39:06,640
plotted on the x-axis is a training<font color="#E5E5E5"> set</font>

944
00:39:04,390 --> 00:39:09,550
size parts on the y-axis is the

945
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:11,349
performance<font color="#CCCCCC"> is the accuracy all the</font>

946
00:39:09,550 --> 00:39:15,820
algorithms do about the same is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

947
00:39:11,349 --> 00:39:16,620
amount of data you have and even<font color="#E5E5E5"> a quote</font>

948
00:39:15,820 --> 00:39:19,890
soup

949
00:39:16,620 --> 00:39:22,500
your<font color="#E5E5E5"> algorithm will often lose to a</font>

950
00:39:19,890 --> 00:39:25,080
quote inferior algorithm if<font color="#E5E5E5"> only you can</font>

951
00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:28,140
give the inferior<font color="#CCCCCC"> alpha more data to</font>

952
00:39:25,080 --> 00:39:30,180
train on yeah so I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think this results</font>

953
00:39:28,140 --> 00:39:32,940
like these that has led to this<font color="#E5E5E5"> Maxim in</font>

954
00:39:30,180 --> 00:39:34,620
machine learning that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know says that</font>

955
00:39:32,940 --> 00:39:36,360
often is not who has the best algorithm

956
00:39:34,620 --> 00:39:38,040
that witnesses who has the most data and

957
00:39:36,360 --> 00:39:39,840
then I definitely see this over and<font color="#E5E5E5"> over</font>

958
00:39:38,040 --> 00:39:41,610
and sleep and value of you if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you look</font>

959
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:43,050
<font color="#CCCCCC">at think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about the most commercially</font>

960
00:39:41,610 --> 00:39:44,970
successful websites you know the ones

961
00:39:43,050 --> 00:39:47,790
making large amounts of<font color="#E5E5E5"> money in that</font>

962
00:39:44,970 --> 00:39:50,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">you Jews pray every day many of those</font>

963
00:39:47,790 --> 00:39:53,820
algorithms are incredibly simple is this

964
00:39:50,490 --> 00:39:57,600
like logistic regression but the secret

965
00:39:53,820 --> 00:40:03,900
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that those albums will fit far more</font>

966
00:39:57,600 --> 00:40:06,990
data than anyone else has so how about

967
00:40:03,900 --> 00:40:10,590
so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is supervised learning um how</font>

968
00:40:06,990 --> 00:40:13,800
about unsupervised learning so Adam

969
00:40:10,590 --> 00:40:16,350
coats as you who helped prepare this

970
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:17,850
handout a few<font color="#E5E5E5"> years ago actually a year</font>

971
00:40:16,350 --> 00:40:19,560
and a<font color="#CCCCCC"> half ago did this interesting</font>

972
00:40:17,850 --> 00:40:21,870
study right where he took all of the

973
00:40:19,560 --> 00:40:25,620
unsupervised feature learning algorithms

974
00:40:21,870 --> 00:40:28,530
of the day<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> various</font>

975
00:40:25,620 --> 00:40:30,030
guys like us I guess debate is my<font color="#E5E5E5"> averin</font>

976
00:40:28,530 --> 00:40:32,250
better as your offer better weather and

977
00:40:30,030 --> 00:40:34,800
he<font color="#E5E5E5"> took a bunch of these algorithms and</font>

978
00:40:32,250 --> 00:40:36,840
ran all of them and they read the model

979
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:39,480
size so for unsupervised feature

980
00:40:36,840 --> 00:40:41,970
learning all<font color="#CCCCCC"> of us have a have a large</font>

981
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:46,200
amount of<font color="#CCCCCC"> data right if you know you're</font>

982
00:40:41,970 --> 00:40:49,770
doing if you're learning<font color="#E5E5E5"> from unlabeled</font>

983
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:51,930
images from natural riches<font color="#E5E5E5"> um you have</font>

984
00:40:49,770 --> 00:40:54,540
an infinite<font color="#E5E5E5"> amount of data right news</font>

985
00:40:51,930 --> 00:40:56,280
and so the parameters the very is not

986
00:40:54,540 --> 00:40:58,170
the amount of data is the size of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

987
00:40:56,280 --> 00:41:00,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">models of how many features do you learn</font>

988
00:40:58,170 --> 00:41:02,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">those coefficients a1 just in the early</font>

989
00:41:00,810 --> 00:41:06,000
example we had 64 coefficients a1

990
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:07,560
through a 64<font color="#E5E5E5"> for sparse coding but let's</font>

991
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:09,480
set that bigger let's learn a thousand

992
00:41:07,560 --> 00:41:11,100
features instead or<font color="#E5E5E5"> 10,000 whatever</font>

993
00:41:09,480 --> 00:41:14,640
let's learn much larger number features

994
00:41:11,100 --> 00:41:17,250
and what Adam found was that you know

995
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:20,549
the album does matter maybe it matters

996
00:41:17,250 --> 00:41:22,349
more than know maybe matt is more than

997
00:41:20,549 --> 00:41:24,059
we respond supervised learning because

998
00:41:22,349 --> 00:41:26,459
these albums are less mature but they

999
00:41:24,059 --> 00:41:28,829
can be sold the silver is out where the

1000
00:41:26,459 --> 00:41:32,099
bigger the model the better it does and

1001
00:41:28,829 --> 00:41:34,859
in fact one interesting historical side

1002
00:41:32,099 --> 00:41:37,829
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> C 4 10 we actually went back and</font>

1003
00:41:34,859 --> 00:41:40,199
historically traced out you know I mean

1004
00:41:37,829 --> 00:41:41,789
we like to publish paper and say my

1005
00:41:40,199 --> 00:41:43,949
Oberon's better than yours yours<font color="#CCCCCC"> valen</font>

1006
00:41:41,789 --> 00:41:46,109
whatever right went back and traced all

1007
00:41:43,949 --> 00:41:48,239
the sequence of papers with you know

1008
00:41:46,109 --> 00:41:50,219
person a published as a result<font color="#CCCCCC"> one</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> CFR</font>

1009
00:41:48,239 --> 00:41:52,349
person be published paper saying oh I

1010
00:41:50,219 --> 00:41:53,910
did<font color="#E5E5E5"> better then person C published in LP</font>

1011
00:41:52,349 --> 00:41:55,589
<font color="#E5E5E5">say I do even better and then the one</font>

1012
00:41:53,910 --> 00:41:58,319
says oh I do even<font color="#E5E5E5"> better in the idea</font>

1013
00:41:55,589 --> 00:42:01,229
where we traced them a couple sequences

1014
00:41:58,319 --> 00:42:04,229
of that of<font color="#E5E5E5"> supposedly benchmarks</font>

1015
00:42:01,229 --> 00:42:06,420
advances<font color="#CCCCCC"> in benchmark that was</font>

1016
00:42:04,229 --> 00:42:09,630
supposedly do 20 miles better than yours

1017
00:42:06,420 --> 00:42:11,279
as I do<font color="#E5E5E5"> better and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we believe that a lot</font>

1018
00:42:09,630 --> 00:42:13,679
<font color="#CCCCCC">of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> those</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> results of the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> supposed</font>

1019
00:42:11,279 --> 00:42:16,499
progress was actually because the models

1020
00:42:13,679 --> 00:42:18,179
got bigger right it's not that my

1021
00:42:16,499 --> 00:42:20,699
algorithm is actually better is it just

1022
00:42:18,179 --> 00:42:23,130
our most law<font color="#E5E5E5"> had more time to work and</font>

1023
00:42:20,699 --> 00:42:24,569
so I<font color="#CCCCCC"> trained my better and so i'm going</font>

1024
00:42:23,130 --> 00:42:27,029
to write a paper<font color="#E5E5E5"> saying my</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ovens better</font>

1025
00:42:24,569 --> 00:42:29,640
in the stuff I've done the one most

1026
00:42:27,029 --> 00:42:32,130
reliable way to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get better results has</font>

1027
00:42:29,640 --> 00:42:33,359
been to train a bigger model if<font color="#E5E5E5"> I change</font>

1028
00:42:32,130 --> 00:42:36,150
the algorithm sometimes it makes it

1029
00:42:33,359 --> 00:42:38,579
better sometimes not but in fact<font color="#CCCCCC"> do I</font>

1030
00:42:36,150 --> 00:42:40,890
you know look at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the literature I feel</font>

1031
00:42:38,579 --> 00:42:43,859
like a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of work</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> by a lot of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> different</font>

1032
00:42:40,890 --> 00:42:46,650
research groups has been in some ways on

1033
00:42:43,859 --> 00:42:50,459
on trying to get these models to just

1034
00:42:46,650 --> 00:42:52,019
train bigger right so in this world of a

1035
00:42:50,459 --> 00:42:53,999
supervised future learning where all of

1036
00:42:52,019 --> 00:42:57,059
us have an infinite amount of data you

1037
00:42:53,999 --> 00:42:59,009
know I feel<font color="#E5E5E5"> like we're not limited by</font>

1038
00:42:57,059 --> 00:43:03,630
what data we have we're much more

1039
00:42:59,009 --> 00:43:05,939
limited by our ability to process the

1040
00:43:03,630 --> 00:43:09,029
infinite amount of data<font color="#E5E5E5"> that all of us</font>

1041
00:43:05,939 --> 00:43:10,499
have all right<font color="#E5E5E5"> so you know many attempts</font>

1042
00:43:09,029 --> 00:43:13,499
to come more efficient algorithms

1043
00:43:10,499 --> 00:43:15,299
parallelization I say<font color="#CCCCCC"> yawns done very</font>

1044
00:43:13,499 --> 00:43:17,429
cool work on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> FPGA and a sec</font>

1045
00:43:15,299 --> 00:43:19,019
implementation oh<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i bought i'm</font>

1046
00:43:17,429 --> 00:43:20,590
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to take credit for bringing GPUs</font>

1047
00:43:19,019 --> 00:43:23,200
to the deep learning world

1048
00:43:20,590 --> 00:43:25,930
um and and and so on a solid work like

1049
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:28,690
this um and in fact looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at this</font>

1050
00:43:25,930 --> 00:43:31,030
chart my personal interpretation which

1051
00:43:28,690 --> 00:43:33,340
others will disagree with is that those

1052
00:43:31,030 --> 00:43:36,550
results were achieved to a very large

1053
00:43:33,340 --> 00:43:38,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">part because of scalability issues right</font>

1054
00:43:36,550 --> 00:43:39,700
but this is my personal interpretation

1055
00:43:38,290 --> 00:43:41,470
which others may disagree with could you

1056
00:43:39,700 --> 00:43:46,690
through the questions seven and eight on

1057
00:43:41,470 --> 00:43:49,000
the handout so question seven whether

1058
00:43:46,690 --> 00:43:53,980
you have which which ones did you<font color="#E5E5E5"> check</font>

1059
00:43:49,000 --> 00:44:01,390
off two and three cool I'll take your

1060
00:43:53,980 --> 00:44:03,490
word for it and for question 80 and I

1061
00:44:01,390 --> 00:44:05,140
just do actually questioning I can't

1062
00:44:03,490 --> 00:44:09,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">talk everything except DNA computing</font>

1063
00:44:05,140 --> 00:44:11,380
them that's my answer anyway yeah I

1064
00:44:09,820 --> 00:44:13,300
thought of putting quantum in there too

1065
00:44:11,380 --> 00:44:17,830
but I think someone actually is working

1066
00:44:13,300 --> 00:44:21,700
on quantum computer yes yeah alright

1067
00:44:17,830 --> 00:44:22,750
cool<font color="#CCCCCC"> so um let's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> see you know what</font>

1068
00:44:21,700 --> 00:44:24,460
there's something else I could talk

1069
00:44:22,750 --> 00:44:28,600
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think I'll do that towards the</font>

1070
00:44:24,460 --> 00:44:31,210
end um so you know just to wrap up this

1071
00:44:28,600 --> 00:44:33,070
piece I think talk about the<font color="#CCCCCC"> high-level</font>

1072
00:44:31,210 --> 00:44:35,290
vision of less learning rather than

1073
00:44:33,070 --> 00:44:37,270
manually designing our<font color="#CCCCCC"> features but</font>

1074
00:44:35,290 --> 00:44:38,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">again kind of for me you know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this isn't</font>

1075
00:44:37,270 --> 00:44:41,920
just about machine learning anymore this

1076
00:44:38,860 --> 00:44:43,960
is I feel<font color="#CCCCCC"> like um can we really learn</font>

1077
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:45,970
something about AI especially perceptual

1078
00:44:43,960 --> 00:44:47,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">ai ai ai and human intelligence is very</font>

1079
00:44:45,970 --> 00:44:48,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">broad i think you know we're we're</font>

1080
00:44:47,770 --> 00:44:50,680
starting to get a handle<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe the</font>

1081
00:44:48,910 --> 00:44:52,510
perceptual part of AI which is maybe

1082
00:44:50,680 --> 00:44:54,610
like you know forty to sixty percent of

1083
00:44:52,510 --> 00:44:58,720
many animal brains right so this big

1084
00:44:54,610 --> 00:45:01,870
part of the brain and so what I'd like

1085
00:44:58,720 --> 00:45:04,060
<font color="#CCCCCC">to do is as I say you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know thank you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

1086
00:45:01,870 --> 00:45:05,650
your<font color="#CCCCCC"> attention</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for your patience with me</font>

1087
00:45:04,060 --> 00:45:08,440
to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> these</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> things I hope that was</font>

1088
00:45:05,650 --> 00:45:11,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">somewhat fun what like to do is let's</font>

1089
00:45:08,440 --> 00:45:13,480
break and later on in the in the next

1090
00:45:11,860 --> 00:45:15,190
couple sessions where you know dive

1091
00:45:13,480 --> 00:45:16,570
slightly deeper into technical details

1092
00:45:15,190 --> 00:45:18,250
go from the basics talk about neural

1093
00:45:16,570 --> 00:45:21,070
networks and builders of the algorithms

1094
00:45:18,250 --> 00:45:23,860
also to the point out that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

1095
00:45:21,070 --> 00:45:24,970
after<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> later today or whatever if you</font>

1096
00:45:23,860 --> 00:45:28,630
want to go

1097
00:45:24,970 --> 00:45:30,520
