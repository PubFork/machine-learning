1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:08,759
like to introduce our guest today dr.

2
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:10,830
face a leak I micholi met Faye I guess

3
00:00:08,759 --> 00:00:13,380
two and a<font color="#CCCCCC"> half years ago</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah leading</font>

4
00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:16,500
the Stanford AI<font color="#CCCCCC"> lab so she's a professor</font>

5
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:19,499
of AI at Stanford and again runs the lab

6
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:23,339
there and then earlier this year joined

7
00:00:19,499 --> 00:00:25,349
Google as their chief scientist of AI in

8
00:00:23,339 --> 00:00:29,130
the Google cloud so welcome thank<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

9
00:00:25,349 --> 00:00:30,300
Mike so you know the<font color="#E5E5E5"> the intent of you</font>

10
00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:32,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">give this discussion</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> from</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> my viewpoint</font>

11
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:34,289
<font color="#CCCCCC">is like there's been</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot of I think</font>

12
00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:37,079
<font color="#E5E5E5">sometimes hype sometimes real and</font>

13
00:00:34,289 --> 00:00:39,089
advances around hey I NML and you know

14
00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:41,100
from moving from the<font color="#CCCCCC"> academic side and</font>

15
00:00:39,089 --> 00:00:43,050
starting<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get exposure so you have a</font>

16
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:45,059
place like Google you know on the

17
00:00:43,050 --> 00:00:48,899
applied side of AML what is something

18
00:00:45,059 --> 00:00:49,980
that's kind of surprised<font color="#CCCCCC"> you like in</font>

19
00:00:48,899 --> 00:00:52,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">that transition that you're getting kind</font>

20
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:56,339
<font color="#E5E5E5">of up to speed at Google that's a great</font>

21
00:00:52,530 --> 00:01:00,719
question like so this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've been</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> at</font>

22
00:00:56,339 --> 00:01:03,480
Google for two months and it's it's

23
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:06,270
actually the first time time I took a

24
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:09,780
<font color="#CCCCCC">deep dive into the industry and i am</font>

25
00:01:06,270 --> 00:01:14,070
very<font color="#E5E5E5"> fortunate to have that sabbatical</font>

26
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:17,549
opportunity so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a couple things</font>

27
00:01:14,070 --> 00:01:22,259
<font color="#E5E5E5">that really surprised the but also</font>

28
00:01:17,549 --> 00:01:24,960
excites me and one<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing is that as a</font>

29
00:01:22,259 --> 00:01:27,990
technologist I've been doing AI for

30
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:30,689
almost 20 years and you know in the

31
00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:33,329
<font color="#E5E5E5">early days i started a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i as an undergrad</font>

32
00:01:30,689 --> 00:01:38,130
and PhD student and then professor in

33
00:01:33,329 --> 00:01:42,810
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> early days this is such a nice small</font>

34
00:01:38,130 --> 00:01:45,570
academically driven problem it's an

35
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:48,479
intellectual pursuit and then<font color="#CCCCCC"> gradually</font>

36
00:01:45,570 --> 00:01:51,750
we really this generation<font color="#E5E5E5"> witness this</font>

37
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:56,159
technology at least<font color="#E5E5E5"> of this wave</font>

38
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:59,579
maturing and making impact and solving

39
00:01:56,159 --> 00:02:02,189
<font color="#CCCCCC">real-world problems so our dream of a i</font>

40
00:01:59,579 --> 00:02:07,350
started also to grow in that process and

41
00:02:02,189 --> 00:02:10,740
I came to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the realization in the past</font>

42
00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:12,930
few years<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we're going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to a lot of</font>

43
00:02:10,740 --> 00:02:13,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">people call the fourth Industrial</font>

44
00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:18,010
Revolution

45
00:02:13,630 --> 00:02:21,280
and I have absolutely<font color="#CCCCCC"> no doubt that AI</font>

46
00:02:18,010 --> 00:02:23,110
is one of the biggest driving force of

47
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:25,870
the Industrial Revolution were

48
00:02:23,110 --> 00:02:29,770
automation and many things are changing

49
00:02:25,870 --> 00:02:32,920
the way humans live and work but there

50
00:02:29,770 --> 00:02:35,260
has always been a question<font color="#E5E5E5"> for me right</font>

51
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:37,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">around the time that I was considering</font>

52
00:02:35,260 --> 00:02:41,950
my sabbatical industry is how do we

53
00:02:37,690 --> 00:02:43,840
democratize this technology so there

54
00:02:41,950 --> 00:02:45,580
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are many reasons we want to</font>

55
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:48,040
democratize first of<font color="#E5E5E5"> all it's a good</font>

56
00:02:45,580 --> 00:02:50,650
thing a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of it is a good thing we</font>

57
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:55,510
want humanities to benefit<font color="#CCCCCC"> from it</font>

58
00:02:50,650 --> 00:02:57,760
second is I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think that I would not want</font>

59
00:02:55,510 --> 00:03:01,750
AI to be in the hands of a few

60
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:07,960
privileged and elite by democratizing it

61
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:13,330
has it helps us to really focus on a

62
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:17,410
benevolent effect of AI and this is

63
00:03:13,330 --> 00:03:20,200
where cloud comes in it took<font color="#CCCCCC"> me a while</font>

64
00:03:17,410 --> 00:03:23,440
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I start realized that cloud is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

65
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:27,820
biggest computing platform humanity has

66
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:33,070
ever created and and cloud what is

67
00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:37,210
computing today computing is to make

68
00:03:33,070 --> 00:03:39,790
your data speak intelligently and act

69
00:03:37,210 --> 00:03:42,520
intelligently to<font color="#E5E5E5"> solve your problem or</font>

70
00:03:39,790 --> 00:03:45,910
your customers problem so<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

71
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:50,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">marriage between AI and cloud is like</font>

72
00:03:45,910 --> 00:03:52,120
this perfect vehicle to democratize and

73
00:03:50,110 --> 00:03:53,620
I do you think that in this fourth<font color="#CCCCCC"> wave</font>

74
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:55,720
as you flow as you're living in a

75
00:03:53,620 --> 00:03:59,620
fantastically describe it is it being

76
00:03:55,720 --> 00:04:01,330
driven then by compute by would say some

77
00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:03,910
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> these advances around within</font>

78
00:04:01,330 --> 00:04:06,160
convolutional neural nets and then is it

79
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:08,530
in is it<font color="#E5E5E5"> also</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the tag label data or what</font>

80
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:10,930
what are the kind of big factors that

81
00:04:08,530 --> 00:04:14,230
have also resulted in a converted kind

82
00:04:10,930 --> 00:04:15,730
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> new yawk the very large noise or into</font>

83
00:04:14,230 --> 00:04:18,489
some signal which<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll talk about a bit</font>

84
00:04:15,730 --> 00:04:21,850
in the same I think you pointed out<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

85
00:04:18,489 --> 00:04:25,270
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> the three major factors are the</font>

86
00:04:21,850 --> 00:04:26,880
computer in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> hardware not only the</font>

87
00:04:25,270 --> 00:04:29,730
huge infrastructure that

88
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:34,560
cloud can provide but also the<font color="#CCCCCC"> GPUs the</font>

89
00:04:29,730 --> 00:04:40,050
remaining advances in hard work then um

90
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:43,950
20 years ago internet brought us

91
00:04:40,050 --> 00:04:47,520
gradually the big data movement and big

92
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:50,190
data and the availability of labeled and

93
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:53,850
annotated big data is the second factor

94
00:04:50,190 --> 00:04:56,220
and then the<font color="#CCCCCC"> third</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> factor is advances of</font>

95
00:04:53,850 --> 00:04:59,850
<font color="#CCCCCC">the algorithms that is what I think</font>

96
00:04:56,220 --> 00:05:03,360
academia have been doing the past AI has

97
00:04:59,850 --> 00:05:07,170
been the field of almost six six five to

98
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:09,390
six decades but in the past 20 years so

99
00:05:07,170 --> 00:05:13,020
these three factors converged and

100
00:05:09,390 --> 00:05:15,630
brought us today ai<font color="#E5E5E5"> and cloud will be</font>

101
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:17,790
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> vehicle to democratize it another</font>

102
00:05:15,630 --> 00:05:18,990
thing so I'm not gonna have time

103
00:05:17,790 --> 00:05:21,570
introduce myself so in general for a

104
00:05:18,990 --> 00:05:23,820
client<font color="#CCCCCC"> birkin yeah we see i see by the</font>

105
00:05:21,570 --> 00:05:27,510
MU 15 companies a week probably<font color="#CCCCCC"> out of</font>

106
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:29,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">the 15 call it 10 to 15 use the terms AI</font>

107
00:05:27,510 --> 00:05:32,040
ml and it's kind of disappointing at

108
00:05:29,610 --> 00:05:34,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">times maybe it's disappoint I'm is a</font>

109
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:37,680
majority those actually when<font color="#CCCCCC"> you push on</font>

110
00:05:34,590 --> 00:05:39,480
their claims either don't really

111
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:42,300
understand what you're saying or I'm

112
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:46,110
really<font color="#CCCCCC"> not using AI and another pair we</font>

113
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:47,460
want your<font color="#E5E5E5"> attention yeah so um cuz I and</font>

114
00:05:46,110 --> 00:05:48,900
unfortunately with a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> money in the</font>

115
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:51,570
ecosystem and so let me accompany the

116
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:54,300
public edge can invest in how do how do

117
00:05:51,570 --> 00:05:56,430
we kind of get past that noise<font color="#CCCCCC"> and we've</font>

118
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:58,560
got<font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> many founders entrepreneurs in</font>

119
00:05:56,430 --> 00:06:01,740
the audience that likely or in some

120
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:03,090
cases doing relay<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm al how happen from</font>

121
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:05,490
your perspective immaculee how do we

122
00:06:03,090 --> 00:06:07,530
going to get that signal above the noise

123
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:11,160
because it is kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a noisy area right</font>

124
00:06:07,530 --> 00:06:13,020
now right i think<font color="#E5E5E5"> there is a couple of</font>

125
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:15,030
things<font color="#CCCCCC"> especially you know you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and I</font>

126
00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:18,420
have been<font color="#E5E5E5"> working together in the</font>

127
00:06:15,030 --> 00:06:21,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">several ab entrepreneur club for</font>

128
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:25,500
students and so I've been also learning

129
00:06:21,870 --> 00:06:28,860
a lot from the the winter capital world

130
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:34,919
I think a couple<font color="#CCCCCC"> of things I would tell</font>

131
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:36,810
startup founders one is that still think

132
00:06:34,919 --> 00:06:40,550
<font color="#CCCCCC">about your problem focus on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the problem</font>

133
00:06:36,810 --> 00:06:44,660
focus on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the problem you want to solve</font>

134
00:06:40,550 --> 00:06:46,460
is the entry going to everything think

135
00:06:44,660 --> 00:06:49,640
about what products you want to deliver

136
00:06:46,460 --> 00:06:53,360
to your problem and and and to your

137
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:55,100
customers to<font color="#E5E5E5"> your users do too and once</font>

138
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:58,580
you have that start<font color="#E5E5E5"> thinking about the</font>

139
00:06:55,100 --> 00:07:02,270
data I think when you talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> to a founder</font>

140
00:06:58,580 --> 00:07:05,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">CEO or CEO it's really important to see</font>

141
00:07:02,270 --> 00:07:08,660
if they have a good grasp of what data

142
00:07:05,210 --> 00:07:10,940
they have and how do they how do they

143
00:07:08,660 --> 00:07:14,540
use their data that is so important

144
00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:17,690
that's the beginning of a IML you<font color="#E5E5E5"> cannot</font>

145
00:07:14,540 --> 00:07:20,330
speak<font color="#E5E5E5"> AM L in that vacuum can I can</font>

146
00:07:17,690 --> 00:07:22,430
interrupt your your listener on the data

147
00:07:20,330 --> 00:07:26,000
size do you think that over time the

148
00:07:22,430 --> 00:07:28,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">groups or companies that have the</font>

149
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:31,520
largest corpus of<font color="#E5E5E5"> tagged data is that</font>

150
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:34,580
where<font color="#CCCCCC"> the IP is going to really sit part</font>

151
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:36,590
of it is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the companies with the big</font>

152
00:07:34,580 --> 00:07:39,230
data and<font color="#E5E5E5"> paths are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to win part of</font>

153
00:07:36,590 --> 00:07:41,720
it but another hand there<font color="#CCCCCC"> is so much</font>

154
00:07:39,230 --> 00:07:45,770
opportunity because these big companies

155
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:48,830
are not going to go deep into verticals

156
00:07:45,770 --> 00:07:52,370
or specific areas there's still a lot of

157
00:07:48,830 --> 00:07:55,280
opportunities or and also and also this

158
00:07:52,370 --> 00:07:59,240
is where the the creativity of<font color="#CCCCCC"> startup</font>

159
00:07:55,280 --> 00:08:02,030
comes in how do you snowball your data

160
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:04,490
you have to have a clever design of the

161
00:08:02,030 --> 00:08:08,180
product and engagement with your

162
00:08:04,490 --> 00:08:13,700
whatever consumer or Turner so that as

163
00:08:08,180 --> 00:08:17,300
as<font color="#CCCCCC"> you begin that process you you your</font>

164
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:21,020
product you you design into the product

165
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:23,030
snowballing effect of data so that

166
00:08:21,020 --> 00:08:26,270
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not just data personally you can</font>

167
00:08:23,030 --> 00:08:28,520
not always assume that<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay I start the</font>

168
00:08:26,270 --> 00:08:30,890
company with all this data and therefore

169
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:33,050
somehow excitable exactly yeah but you

170
00:08:30,890 --> 00:08:34,760
have to have a pattern strategy yeah and

171
00:08:33,050 --> 00:08:35,870
the other way otherwise every<font color="#CCCCCC"> Cavill</font>

172
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:38,900
competition with is very valuable

173
00:08:35,870 --> 00:08:41,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">exactly right so that's one thing data</font>

174
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:43,910
the other thing is<font color="#CCCCCC"> I guess if a company</font>

175
00:08:41,870 --> 00:08:46,670
truly understand data truly understand

176
00:08:43,910 --> 00:08:49,940
the value<font color="#CCCCCC"> of data analytics then they</font>

177
00:08:46,670 --> 00:08:53,570
should invest in a<font color="#CCCCCC"> good depending on the</font>

178
00:08:49,940 --> 00:08:54,020
on the product data scientist AI machine

179
00:08:53,570 --> 00:08:56,360
learning

180
00:08:54,020 --> 00:08:58,520
experts and that's where homework needs

181
00:08:56,360 --> 00:09:00,620
to be done so let's push on that<font color="#E5E5E5"> Allah</font>

182
00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:01,760
so she can<font color="#CCCCCC"> attend</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> everyone so I totally</font>

183
00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:05,810
agree with you I'm focusing<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the</font>

184
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:07,430
problem and unite you mentioned that you

185
00:09:05,810 --> 00:09:09,320
know periodic member of the week

186
00:09:07,430 --> 00:09:10,730
spending time<font color="#E5E5E5"> with some of your grad</font>

187
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:12,950
students<font color="#E5E5E5"> on what are the opportunities</font>

188
00:09:10,730 --> 00:09:15,200
and applications and you know we have

189
00:09:12,950 --> 00:09:16,940
this 117 spectrum we mentioned kind of

190
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:19,490
the noise<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then we can have the other</font>

191
00:09:16,940 --> 00:09:21,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">side of section which is because the PhD</font>

192
00:09:19,490 --> 00:09:24,140
students or the first<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing is finished</font>

193
00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:25,550
I can say this is the PhD drop out where

194
00:09:24,140 --> 00:09:27,560
he or she<font color="#E5E5E5"> feels like they've got a</font>

195
00:09:25,550 --> 00:09:30,620
hammer right and everything looks like a

196
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:32,030
nail right and so you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of how</font>

197
00:09:30,620 --> 00:09:33,920
and officially in this area when you're

198
00:09:32,030 --> 00:09:35,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">building a company just want to solve</font>

199
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:39,440
the problem you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not in love with the</font>

200
00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:41,150
algorithm or the approach how you hear

201
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:42,710
about how do you kind of give guidance

202
00:09:41,150 --> 00:09:44,960
to the folk science around that as well

203
00:09:42,710 --> 00:09:47,270
as how do you hire someone in the area

204
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:48,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">that and kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of mitigate this risk of</font>

205
00:09:47,270 --> 00:09:54,050
not just in love with a piece of paper

206
00:09:48,590 --> 00:09:57,710
so I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't know Mike there is one</font>

207
00:09:54,050 --> 00:10:01,670
singular answer because sometimes that

208
00:09:57,710 --> 00:10:05,060
tremendous hammer vision the technology

209
00:10:01,670 --> 00:10:08,510
vision does drive crazy too long arc

210
00:10:05,060 --> 00:10:10,520
that no one<font color="#E5E5E5"> have seen the usage and we</font>

211
00:10:08,510 --> 00:10:12,620
should push on that technology I mean no

212
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:16,310
way Google started as a search<font color="#CCCCCC"> engine</font>

213
00:10:12,620 --> 00:10:19,250
where the<font color="#E5E5E5"> product vision was not yet</font>

214
00:10:16,310 --> 00:10:21,950
mature yet that technology drove that so

215
00:10:19,250 --> 00:10:24,890
sometimes that those opportunities do

216
00:10:21,950 --> 00:10:32,060
exists but also I agree with you that

217
00:10:24,890 --> 00:10:34,220
many times technologists who want to go

218
00:10:32,060 --> 00:10:37,550
solve a real-world problem have to

219
00:10:34,220 --> 00:10:40,640
develop that empathetic understanding of

220
00:10:37,550 --> 00:10:44,990
the problem and and and<font color="#E5E5E5"> what you want to</font>

221
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:47,990
deliver just stay staying at the thesis

222
00:10:44,990 --> 00:10:51,080
dissertation paper level is not enough

223
00:10:47,990 --> 00:10:54,410
it's really important to come come by

224
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:56,480
now with empathetic you know there's a

225
00:10:54,410 --> 00:10:58,340
discipline to really force yourself to

226
00:10:56,480 --> 00:11:00,380
be in reading about I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think that's right</font>

227
00:10:58,340 --> 00:11:01,550
when you can look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the discussions</font>

228
00:11:00,380 --> 00:11:04,730
you're having with students that ain't a

229
00:11:01,550 --> 00:11:05,930
witch get recruit a<font color="#E5E5E5"> quick Google or for</font>

230
00:11:04,730 --> 00:11:09,740
the summit on of stress

231
00:11:05,930 --> 00:11:11,450
car company there's a new startup what's

232
00:11:09,740 --> 00:11:13,370
the guidance that you give your students

233
00:11:11,450 --> 00:11:15,470
on how to either have that discussion

234
00:11:13,370 --> 00:11:18,710
around a problem with the potential

235
00:11:15,470 --> 00:11:20,060
customer or find a co-founder to that

236
00:11:18,710 --> 00:11:21,800
because I they recognize the fact that

237
00:11:20,060 --> 00:11:23,600
hey I'm a technologist I need to find a

238
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:27,140
product person or a<font color="#E5E5E5"> business person</font>

239
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:32,089
that's why I bring you guys to talk to

240
00:11:27,140 --> 00:11:36,740
this person so I come<font color="#CCCCCC"> to tell you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> them</font>

241
00:11:32,089 --> 00:11:39,380
said first of<font color="#E5E5E5"> all I'm a professor that</font>

242
00:11:36,740 --> 00:11:42,770
first tell them go be a professor that's

243
00:11:39,380 --> 00:11:44,600
my first but if they<font color="#CCCCCC"> say no I absolutely</font>

244
00:11:42,770 --> 00:11:46,399

help you I've good friends I can

246
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:51,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">introduce you to but I think it's really</font>

247
00:11:48,620 --> 00:11:56,959
<font color="#E5E5E5">about um I tell them take away the</font>

248
00:11:51,860 --> 00:11:59,600
romance it's when you're really dive

249
00:11:56,959 --> 00:12:03,890
into a startup world as a technologist

250
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:08,450
try to take all the fluff of the romance

251
00:12:03,890 --> 00:12:11,570
out and really get<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the ground focus</font>

252
00:12:08,450 --> 00:12:17,270
on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the technology on the problem and and</font>

253
00:12:11,570 --> 00:12:19,820
try to recognize<font color="#E5E5E5"> that um you don't know</font>

254
00:12:17,270 --> 00:12:23,990
everything you know as a technologist

255
00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:26,690
and seek guidance or mentorship or help

256
00:12:23,990 --> 00:12:30,260
or partners that can complete that

257
00:12:26,690 --> 00:12:32,779
picture for<font color="#CCCCCC"> you to really at the end of</font>

258
00:12:30,260 --> 00:12:35,779
the day is about delivering what your

259
00:12:32,779 --> 00:12:38,750
customer and users want it's not<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

260
00:12:35,779 --> 00:12:41,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">that one line</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of equation that is very</font>

261
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:45,140
flashy so I promised you before hands of

262
00:12:41,930 --> 00:12:48,200
that guy's<font color="#E5E5E5"> cutie difficult but I mean</font>

263
00:12:45,140 --> 00:12:51,050
<font color="#CCCCCC">clearly your world I mean globally</font>

264
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:52,970
recognized as a leader in a i had many

265
00:12:51,050 --> 00:12:56,180
different opportunities i'm sure during

266
00:12:52,970 --> 00:13:00,890
her sabbatical ago why<font color="#CCCCCC"> google haha</font>

267
00:12:56,180 --> 00:13:04,130
thanks<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> asking yes that's a good</font>

268
00:13:00,890 --> 00:13:05,899
question i actually did take some time

269
00:13:04,130 --> 00:13:09,020
to think about it<font color="#CCCCCC"> i was fortunate enough</font>

270
00:13:05,899 --> 00:13:10,850
to have multiple opportunities i think

271
00:13:09,020 --> 00:13:14,390
at the end of the day was what i just

272
00:13:10,850 --> 00:13:17,360
said i want to democratize AI<font color="#E5E5E5"> i really</font>

273
00:13:14,390 --> 00:13:18,710
believe this technology is so important

274
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:22,250
for the entire

275
00:13:18,710 --> 00:13:24,680
manatee that we shouldn't keep it in the

276
00:13:22,250 --> 00:13:26,840
hands of a few and when I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think about</font>

277
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:28,940
from an industry point of view how we

278
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:31,370
democratize AI we should really<font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font>

279
00:13:28,940 --> 00:13:34,220
about all the important verticals today

280
00:13:31,370 --> 00:13:36,530
that can benefit from AI in<font color="#E5E5E5"> Silicon</font>

281
00:13:34,220 --> 00:13:39,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">Valley we tend to have a little bit</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of a</font>

282
00:13:36,530 --> 00:13:41,450
myopia or the skewed view about

283
00:13:39,260 --> 00:13:44,090
industries about high-tech<font color="#CCCCCC"> access</font>

284
00:13:41,450 --> 00:13:47,750
self-driving cars and social<font color="#CCCCCC"> media but</font>

285
00:13:44,090 --> 00:13:50,450
really if you look at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> world there is</font>

286
00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:55,070
finance health care education

287
00:13:50,450 --> 00:13:57,890
manufacturing agriculture you know just

288
00:13:55,070 --> 00:14:00,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">government there are so many vertical</font>

289
00:13:57,890 --> 00:14:05,360
sectors that would benefit from this

290
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:08,810
technology<font color="#E5E5E5"> and if that well they arrive</font>

291
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:12,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">at that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> conclusion I want the best</font>

292
00:14:08,810 --> 00:14:15,170
platform to democratize AI those are so

293
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:19,280
clear that cloud is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the best</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Russell and</font>

294
00:14:15,170 --> 00:14:25,970
and Google<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a company with the deepest</font>

295
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:27,530
AI technology and the cloud so so I sure

296
00:14:25,970 --> 00:14:30,080
would you use the vision and the

297
00:14:27,530 --> 00:14:32,090
opportunity and excitement there one of

298
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:33,740
the kind of obvious implications there

299
00:14:32,090 --> 00:14:35,840
may be a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of displaced job</font>

300
00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:37,580
potentially as we go to some of these

301
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:38,870
how do you think about<font color="#E5E5E5"> it how does I</font>

302
00:14:37,580 --> 00:14:41,750
mean with what you can comment from

303
00:14:38,870 --> 00:14:43,640
google cloud how do<font color="#CCCCCC"> we solve that</font>

304
00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:45,860
problem I mean in terms<font color="#E5E5E5"> of we've got a</font>

305
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:48,470
lot of displaced workers retrain or how

306
00:14:45,860 --> 00:14:51,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">everything okay yeah so um I think</font>

307
00:14:48,470 --> 00:14:53,690
that's a really<font color="#CCCCCC"> important topic and as</font>

308
00:14:51,110 --> 00:14:57,230
an AI person I<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think we all have</font>

309
00:14:53,690 --> 00:14:59,720
responsibilities to to think beyond just

310
00:14:57,230 --> 00:15:03,170
the technology or the codes but into the

311
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:06,980
social implication I want to<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

312
00:15:03,170 --> 00:15:09,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">little crow to one fact when ATM</font>

313
00:15:06,980 --> 00:15:14,630
machines are introduced to the bank

314
00:15:09,740 --> 00:15:18,410
which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> a way to automate a lot of bank</font>

315
00:15:14,630 --> 00:15:21,530
tellers jobs right now you just go to

00:15:18,410 --> 00:15:26,720
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Machine and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do the basic thing the</font>

00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:32,820
increased not decreased

00:15:29,490 --> 00:15:36,270
<font color="#CCCCCC">that's a single</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> small small example to</font>

320
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:42,300
show when certain jobs are being

321
00:15:36,270 --> 00:15:46,529
replaced by machines humans we have a

322
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:48,450
tendency to crave more different jobs to

323
00:15:46,529 --> 00:15:51,089
<font color="#CCCCCC">make the service better to make</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

324
00:15:48,450 --> 00:15:54,360
product better to reach deeper into the

325
00:15:51,089 --> 00:15:56,910
needs of consumers so today's bank

326
00:15:54,360 --> 00:16:00,180
tellers do a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> things</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that are a</font>

327
00:15:56,910 --> 00:16:02,339
little more<font color="#E5E5E5"> fun higher level than just</font>

328
00:16:00,180 --> 00:16:05,700
processing checks and giving you the

329
00:16:02,339 --> 00:16:08,820
cash so I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is where we need to</font>

330
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:11,070
be going collectively as a society I'm

331
00:16:08,820 --> 00:16:14,279
not an economist and I'm not a policy

332
00:16:11,070 --> 00:16:16,800
maker but we try to bring<font color="#E5E5E5"> that voice to</font>

333
00:16:14,279 --> 00:16:19,980
the to the years of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> policy makers is</font>

334
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:22,529
that it is time<font color="#E5E5E5"> to think about how a is</font>

335
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:27,180
killing<font color="#CCCCCC"> in backdrops you know the</font>

00:16:27,180 --> 00:16:30,029
into the<font color="#CCCCCC"> caravan killing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

338
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:32,610
opportunities are creative<font color="#E5E5E5"> officious</font>

339
00:16:30,029 --> 00:16:35,640
exactly here we need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> proactively</font>

340
00:16:32,610 --> 00:16:38,730
start thinking about that my hunt is

341
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:40,890
that the world is this is a growing time

342
00:16:38,730 --> 00:16:43,110
I guess I'm an optimist this is a

343
00:16:40,890 --> 00:16:45,120
growing pie this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is not a zero-sum game</font>

344
00:16:43,110 --> 00:16:48,570
and we<font color="#E5E5E5"> need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be growing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this pie</font>

345
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:51,450
together so mom you know if I'm a

346
00:16:48,570 --> 00:16:55,020
company in the audience and I had some

347
00:16:51,450 --> 00:16:56,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">ideas around what AI or ml could</font>

348
00:16:55,020 --> 00:16:59,520
potentially do with my product and

349
00:16:56,430 --> 00:17:01,829
impact my customer what what can I

350
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:03,779
guidance can<font color="#E5E5E5"> you give from like helping</font>

351
00:17:01,829 --> 00:17:05,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">that means like either vet or recruit</font>

352
00:17:03,779 --> 00:17:08,579
those folks they can compete with your

353
00:17:05,970 --> 00:17:10,679
<font color="#E5E5E5">current employer which a little bit</font>

354
00:17:08,579 --> 00:17:12,030
maybe put your position but it's a

355
00:17:10,679 --> 00:17:14,280
question I get a lot it's like<font color="#CCCCCC"> well I</font>

356
00:17:12,030 --> 00:17:16,410
need<font color="#CCCCCC"> the data scientist ago I can't find</font>

357
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:20,490
he or she or how I festa said I don't

358
00:17:16,410 --> 00:17:26,280
<font color="#CCCCCC">have a PhD in the area yeah do your</font>

359
00:17:20,490 --> 00:17:29,160
homework<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean how is that so um there</font>

360
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:32,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">are many things you know look at their</font>

361
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:35,340
degrees look at what they have done look

362
00:17:32,550 --> 00:17:37,110
at<font color="#E5E5E5"> even if someone doesn't have a formal</font>

machine learning or data science degree

364
00:17:37,110 --> 00:17:42,040
there are so many online courses<font color="#CCCCCC"> cago</font>

365
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:44,770
the

366
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:46,780
there is you know developers forums look

367
00:17:44,770 --> 00:17:49,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">at what they have done that github can</font>

368
00:17:46,780 --> 00:17:50,800
have they you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know depending what kind</font>

372
00:17:55,630 --> 00:18:02,110
diligence and see what they have

373
00:17:57,850 --> 00:18:05,980
produced talk to<font color="#E5E5E5"> your engineers talk to</font>

374
00:18:02,110 --> 00:18:08,920
your<font color="#E5E5E5"> vc's talk to your mentors I think</font>

375
00:18:05,980 --> 00:18:12,010
at the end of the day it's about that

376
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:14,590
CEO or that co-founder or founder doing

377
00:18:12,010 --> 00:18:16,540
his or her<font color="#E5E5E5"> homework yeah i agree i</font>

378
00:18:14,590 --> 00:18:18,730
missed again one of the things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">other professors at Stanford is</font>

381
00:18:19,990 --> 00:18:24,250
periodically we see stories and larger

382
00:18:22,390 --> 00:18:26,800
companies that have this really

383
00:18:24,250 --> 00:18:30,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">interesting data set or corpus and they</font>

384
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:31,510
can't hire these data scientists and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

385
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:33,070
same token on the academic side is

386
00:18:31,510 --> 00:18:36,640
always a desired of like we find the

387
00:18:33,070 --> 00:18:37,930
problems helps with grants etc etc what

388
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:40,150
are your<font color="#E5E5E5"> thoughts on I can better</font>

389
00:18:37,930 --> 00:18:42,310
connect that that linkage of the private

sector<font color="#CCCCCC"> and academia where there may be</font>

391
00:18:42,310 --> 00:18:47,200
people that want to go to the professor

392
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:48,700
but there<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a incredible data set let's</font>

393
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:51,160
say<font color="#E5E5E5"> from this commerce company that may</font>

394
00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:54,280
have been hiring well first of all

395
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:57,760
consider clouds come to 12 yes there is

396
00:18:54,280 --> 00:19:00,970
more and more startups and fortune 500

397
00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:03,940
companies using the cloud is one of the

398
00:19:00,970 --> 00:19:07,120
values we provide<font color="#CCCCCC"> at Google Cloud is is</font>

399
00:19:03,940 --> 00:19:09,160
that we do the computing and solve some

400
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:12,280
of your problems for for you right like

401
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:14,680
not everybody has to be a ninja<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

402
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:16,510
everything but they could<font color="#E5E5E5"> drink a little</font>

403
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:18,130
bit deeper<font color="#CCCCCC"> side I agree on the compute</font>

404
00:19:16,510 --> 00:19:20,680
but when we start talking about feature

405
00:19:18,130 --> 00:19:23,110
engineering and building models for a

406
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:25,240
unique problem I don't know if Google

407
00:19:23,110 --> 00:19:27,040
will necessarily help with that actually

408
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:28,990
it does I mean I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> want to be just</font>

409
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:31,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">Google eccentric but let me push back a</font>

410
00:19:28,990 --> 00:19:34,300
little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit you know if you look at some</font>

411
00:19:31,330 --> 00:19:36,520
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> our the AI product we offer on the</font>

412
00:19:34,300 --> 00:19:38,620
cloud is exactly first of all deep

413
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:40,600
learning takes away feature engineering

414
00:19:38,620 --> 00:19:43,000
that's part of the revolution of deep

415
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:46,510
learning machine learning that preceded

416
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:49,900
deep learning was takes more nuanced

417
00:19:46,510 --> 00:19:51,850
expertise to 22 into<font color="#E5E5E5"> the problem</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

418
00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:54,040
really need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> know how to do feature</font>

419
00:19:51,850 --> 00:19:57,520
engineering but deep learning you

420
00:19:54,040 --> 00:20:01,600
make that a lot easier<font color="#E5E5E5"> and better second</font>

421
00:19:57,520 --> 00:20:04,150
second is that cloud through the api's

422
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:08,320
and other you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> at Google we even</font>

423
00:20:04,150 --> 00:20:11,200
have a lab that brings<font color="#E5E5E5"> people into the</font>

424
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:14,800
lab to to work with you handing hand to

425
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:16,900
look at<font color="#E5E5E5"> your data formulate your problem</font>

426
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:21,550
and solve the problem so there is a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot</font>

427
00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:23,380
of services<font color="#E5E5E5"> we do provide into I think</font>

428
00:20:21,550 --> 00:20:27,640
collaboration this world is so connected

429
00:20:23,380 --> 00:20:30,010
sometimes as<font color="#E5E5E5"> I start of you need to or</font>

430
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:32,560
company nothing put yankin is a sales

431
00:20:30,010 --> 00:20:35,530
spot but I mean Microsoft has a pretty

432
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:38,500
rich offering measure and ml 2 so how do

433
00:20:35,530 --> 00:20:40,030
I should<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think about google versus max</font>

434
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:45,460
that works<font color="#E5E5E5"> I try both to see what works</font>

435
00:20:40,030 --> 00:20:48,010
best for<font color="#CCCCCC"> me or so um</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I said earlier I</font>

436
00:20:45,460 --> 00:20:50,470
decided to<font color="#E5E5E5"> go in Google as a I</font>

437
00:20:48,010 --> 00:20:54,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">technologist because Google has the best</font>

438
00:20:50,470 --> 00:20:56,320
AI technology and if you look at what

439
00:20:54,130 --> 00:20:58,360
Google and<font color="#CCCCCC"> alphabetically by their</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> feet</font>

440
00:20:56,320 --> 00:21:01,390
so it makes a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of sense yeah exactly</font>

441
00:20:58,360 --> 00:21:06,490
i did a little bit with my feet from

442
00:21:01,390 --> 00:21:09,910
what google bring our deep mind rest of

443
00:21:06,490 --> 00:21:12,100
Google research I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that deep</font>

444
00:21:09,910 --> 00:21:15,940
technology and today some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> Google's</font>

445
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:19,030
own products are running on Google's

446
00:21:15,940 --> 00:21:21,370
deep learning technology I think that

447
00:21:19,030 --> 00:21:22,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">speaks volume about that what a lot of</font>

448
00:21:21,370 --> 00:21:25,630
doctoring<font color="#E5E5E5"> there yeah i know we're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> out of</font>

449
00:21:22,990 --> 00:21:28,420
time but ok thank<font color="#E5E5E5"> you so much for</font>

450
00:21:25,630 --> 00:21:29,680
everything imagic it's phenomenal that

451
00:21:28,420 --> 00:21:31,510
you're at Google working with diane and

452
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:33,380
can we can see what you<font color="#CCCCCC"> and your team</font>

453
00:21:31,510 --> 00:21:36,100
built<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay thank you</font>

454
00:21:33,380 --> 00:21:39,510
[Applause]

455
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:39,510
ok
